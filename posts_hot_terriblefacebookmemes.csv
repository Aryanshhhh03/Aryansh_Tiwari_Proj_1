There are a lot of people on both sides of the political spectrum that despise golf.|Surprised this is here since those who usually use shooting ranges lick the boots of rich guys who golf all the time.|I enjoy golf and shooting but the lack of long range shooting ranges in my area makes me kinda wish at least one of the golf courses could be one.|Crazy that someone would want a shooting range instead of a perfectly good car park|Mm, because an open, well maintained field cannot possibly be arranged as a shooting range and a golf course.|High fives all around the water cooler when you show your broworkers this meme.|Nah, golf is boring and shooting is fun|Country clubs and cemeteries are the biggest wasters of prime real estate! - Al Czervic, Caddyshack|Why not use it for both purposes?

Nothing surprises me after learning that|For reasons you can probably guess, I've been thinking a lot about conspiracy theories in recent years. Basically all conspiracy theories are the result of wanting to believe something because it's emotionally gratifying but running into facts that contradict what you believe. The conspiracy theory is an attempt to dismiss the inconvenient facts.

In the case of the moon landing, the motivation could possibly be wanting to believe that the scientific establishment or the U.S. government don't really know what they're doing and can't get big and impressive things done. The fact that they got humans on the moon contradicts that, so you have to imagine that it didn't really happen.|Picture 1: light reflecting off the moon

Elders often do have a lot of knowledge about things but also, a LOT of that knowledge will be about times that have already passed, info that does not anymore work or the subject its about is no longer in use, see the common ""look at how the young people can´t use x thing"" when x thing has been out of use for our whole lives and maybe we have seen it once in a museum/shelf in storage or as a decorative item.

There is also the side truth, older people are products of their times and quite often are a bit slow to pick up or to get on with the times, humor that is considered rude or even flat out racist could be normal for them, standards of beauty, clothing or ways to act in situations that no one does could be obvious things you should be doing to them.

A year later, I went down the slide, landed on my ass, and broke my tailbone. It was excruciating. In both cases, the supervisors refused to help us or send us to the nurse.


Twenty something years later, I became a supervisor at that same school. And those damn pebbles are still there. I *never* let a kid jump off the play structure on my watch. And I always told them why: Because of those rocks. *It was fucking dangerous.*


Our supervisors failed us. I wasn't going to fail them.|It's weird how people think this a flex.|I had a friend become paralyzed from the waist down due to falling off the monkey bars|So uh... I'm on the old side of Millinial. My two sisters are cosidered gen x but not me.

I literally broke my back and was told to walk it off. I found out a couple years ago it had been broke and the bones there fused together. I have had back pain forever. 

This has some merit to it.|Idk man some kid got hospitalized back in elementary school by falling down the spider pyramid thingy.|These the same people who now demand every possible safety precaution for their own kids?|Judging by the lack of impulse control I have seen with Gen X, I'm guessing some parts of the prefrontal cortex were damaged during the fall.|Its called progress. We spot things that no longer serve us and we correct them. 

Kids getting injured over some fucking monkey bars is stupid. So we mitigate that risk. 

They think ""its not a big deal"" means ignore it when it means - if it is not a big deal then why are we getting such life changing injuries from it? That means we are being ineffectual fuckheads. 

If you cant provide safe equipment for the children in your care then fuck you moron is how I feel. It isn't that hard. Why would we glorify fucking up? 

I swear these people just have hate in their hearts and want people to suffer because they suffered. They try to hide it behind these faux ""practicality"" arguments but they always fail at making any real sense. 

There is nothing practical about a broken arm at recess. Its fucking *recess*. If what you provide for kids to blow of some steam for 30 mins a day  is hurting them that severely *then you suck and do not deserve praise* you deserve shame.|They say just walk it off, then complain that they hurt constantly from just moving.|I got tetanus just looking at it|Gen X:

 - in the 90s they were anarchists

 - today they lick boots and bitch about the people who don't 

 - scared of everyone who isn't exactly like the three people in their active friend group|Of course Gen X is going to start stealing Boomer memes. It's sad.|These are always so baffling to me, they're the generation that gave birth to late millennials/gen Z, they're the ones who made a fuzz over their kids being harmed in playgrounds. Are they... Are they clowning on their own kids...? On themselves...? This makes no sense.|Yeah, you hear that snowflakes? Nobody cares! Not even your parents!

Yeah, that's pretty fucked.|I remember showing off to my teacher that I could finally cross the monkey bars... only to fall halfway through and sprain my ankle on the really hard packed sand underneath. A classmate slipped off and broke his wrist under the same monkey bars a year later. It's been almost 20 years and I'm hoping that they upkeep those monkey bar areas now.|Imagine thinking ""no one really cares"" is a good message for children.|I once saw a YouTube video about playgrounds in Germany. They discovered that children treated dangerous objects as dangerous, so they are much more ok with unsafe playground, since it doesn't end in more injury. It also helps with child development.|“It’ll feel better when the pain goes away.”  Thanks, Unc.",terriblefacebookmemes,1i00uyw

However when reading the paper, it's really just that they're about the same in the variables tested (could/should have gone more in depth), and the better is coming under assumption that the new product is cheaper, however it's experimental so there is no cost analysis I could find.|And that's why the people who always tell me the scientists are wrong are never funded by people who have been destroying the planet for decades and have known they're doing it for 50 years now...|https://www.the-scientist.com/merck-published-fake-journal-44190#:~:text=Merck%20paid%20an%20undisclosed%20sum,tools%20with%20no%20disclosure%20of

“Merck published fake journal

The Big Pharma company paid publisher Elsevier to create something with the look and feel of a peer-reviewed publication to serve as a marketing tool.”

Sometimes the science isn’t actually good science. Most of the time, yes. But scientists are people after all, who can be corrupted just like anyone else.|Wel I'm a scientist andl I've worked for multiple crown research institutions, plus the government, and none of them told me to find anything, they just told me what they wanted me to research and asked for regular updates. 

So either my whole life has been a lie (and all the hundreds of people I've ever collaborated with) and I've been getting paid for nothing, or people need to stick to their lane?

At least we wouldn't have to see shit like this if they were still aggressively enforcing it.|Every scientist and researcher I know is kinda broke from their student loans|A lot of scientists around the world: ""Funding? We're supposed to get funding?""|Study finds: corruption exists 

wild stuff.|How dare they sully Steamboat Willy like that|1. Scientists are not incorruptible and results can be inherently biased and can introduce error no matter how objective and accurate a scientist tries to be. 

2. The fact that this is a possibility is not a reason nor is it proof that your conspiracy theory or miracle medicines or pseudoscientific woo cooked up by grifters and idiots is better than the major consensus of people who actually have practical experience in the areas they are researching. 

3. That is why peer review is important to the process, so that others outside of the sphere of influence can criticize and question the outcomes and conclusions of those improperly conducted or biased results, studies, and/or experiments and propose progressively improved versions of the previously published models and experiments that lead to different, more accurate, more consistent results. 

4. Steamboat Willy has *nothing* to do with this and the choice to use that as a meme template is odd at the very least.

All memes like this consistently make the same fallacy: The Nirvana Fallacy. The assumption that because something doesn’t work perfectly it means it doesn’t work at all. Like many things in life scientific study and research is not an all or nothing bet.|I can understand why someone would come to this conclusion based on surface-level understanding and no critical thinking skills. What they're actually seeing is a phenomenon where the funding organization has the power to shut down research once it isn't going their way and spend loads of money to bury those results. On the other hand, when the research does go their way, they spend lots of money to show it off to everyone. So we mostly only see the insurances where the scientists ""agree"" with the funding organization.

There aren't too many situations where a scientist would feel the need to lie or skew their data. Ethical research is done by a contracted third party (a company that specializes in research or a university). If the funding for the study they're currently doing gets pulled, they just pick up another one or find a new sponsor. It's hard to bribe scientists because there are typically pretty thorough procedures to ensure results are accurate. That's why the majority of the scandals we see are either done in-house or by ""independent researchers."" In those cases, they are usually going into the research with a bias, too. See the black plastic kitchen utensils study.|*whomever",terriblefacebookmemes,1hztxyu

They just miss the cheap labor and molestation targets. Now kids are mostly too smart for either and they can fucking die mad about it as far as I am concerned.

When my mother was growing up a family friend SA'd her for years. She told her mom. Her mother punished her by locking her in the basement with no food or light for 3 days.

What do they care if you don’t get the answers you’re looking for, or get frustrated enough to hang up.|W-why is it on a car?|that sign actually makes a good point. 

It's really an issue with outsourcing labor in general.|This is an AI format - a few emojis, an AI-generated image,  and then lines of ellipses to hide all the tags at the bottom.|I try to be patient but it is frustrating when I can’t understand them and they can’t understand me. what’s the point? I have a problem and they can’t help me. 

Not sure why this is on a car though lol|I’m with the boomers on this one.

I’m not mad at the person on the other end of the phone call though. I’m mad at the company for putting both of us in this situation. You think dude wants to be sitting on the phone all day dealing with angry customers he can barely understand with risk of losing his job at any moment for pretty much slave wages? Doubt it. 

It’s infuriating as a customer to have a problem and need customer service but still being unable to solve my problem due to language barriers and customer support agents being powerless drones just following a script. The language barrier is just icing on the cake.

To make things even worse, usually you’ve already been waiting on hold, or gone through a bunch of options on their menus, or otherwise been on the phone longer than you wanted to be  *before you even get to talk to the human you can’t understand*|Tip: Opt into Spanish and then when the operator answers, tell them you don't speak Spanish, only English, and you must have pressed the wrong button.

Navigating through the menus just to talk to somebody is hard enough since the robot always insists that it can fix your issue when it definitely cannot. Then most times there's not even an option to contact support and you just have to spam click until you break it.

Then you do all that just to get connected to somebody who doesn't understand your issue 50% of the time|""You are talking with someone who speaks English.  It's also a way of developing your atrocious listening skills.""|Kinda got a point. But also. From my experience they speak very well, and the issue is that they can’t really help with the issue I’m having.|Looks like bad photoshop. It’s on the front windshield|I mean this meme isn’t wrong, so many companies outsource their customer service to countries and foreign companies where English is barely if not spoken at all and the robot customer service things barely work for even easy problems so it’s almost automatic that you have to talk with someone.

On another note this being AI also just makes it automatically suck imo.|They said for English, not well spoken English|Welcome to America where the only person who has to learn a new language is the American 😂|You get to talk to people?|So true|Because they also have people that barely speak Spanish available if you prefer.|Why tape a piece of paper over half your windshield?",terriblefacebookmemes,1hun57c

More trees or bushes or grass or something. It's not just solar panels.

EDIT: So I don't have to respond to everyone wondering how solar panel farms can mix with normal farms, [here's a video by Matt Farrell on the topic of Agrivoltaic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgZBlD-TCFE), or mixing Solar Farming with normal Farming. Search for Agrivoltaic on youtube to find more up to date videos to see how it has progressed since his video 3 years ago.|Nuclear power is the answer|Where’s an open pit coal mine ?|look less natural = bad apparently|OoOoOoOo noooooo!

Pork, fish, chicken, sheep, and protein rich vegetarian and vegan options, all of which are environmentally more friendly than cows and, frankly, mostly healthier. 



Now, second question, what is the alternatives to solar power? Wind, hydro electric (both great but dependent on local climate to work properly), nuclear (just good really but may be politically difficult and expensive in initial cost and/or unnecessary as the amount of power needed in an area is just not that high), wood (incredibly difficult since that requires a ton of wood but technically possible, though I don't think many exist), gas, or coal (gas and coal are environmental and health nightmares, there's a reason ExxonMobil ceos don't house their children in coal mines, they house native American children in coal mines!). So, some are arguably better but solar is pretty great all around.|No man's sky ass planet|Years ago, they tried to put solar so that there are no cow grazing. All the places with desert were hyped. But you can just put it on the roof of everything and make them more resistant to back out.


I have solar on my outdoor camera. My out door light. You can increase the time range and energy by using mirrors. In hotter climates, a small fan could cool the panels and increase solar to electricity (5w fan can get 10% increase). Cooler panels also last longer.|Cows are obliterating the planet. We have to kill all of the cows. This is something I definitely believe and have said before.|Bottom pic looks AI generated asf. Some of these comments even look AI generated.

Cows have a much larger footprin than what we see in this picture. The calories we can get from cows is a small fraction of the calories we need to feed cows. They are one of the least efficient sources of calories. I'm not a vegan or anything. I still eat burgers and steaks, but you have to acknowledge that reducing beef consumption is actually going to make a difference. Cows are also major producers of methane, a greenhouse gas.

There is a lot wrong with the lower picture depicting the imagery of ""where babies come from"" in the carrot world. 


In the real world carrots start from seed that is produced by the foliage part of the carrot. 


The comic depicts these adult carrots in such a way to elude the ideals of a jaded human and thier twisted view of male female relationships lacking of a sexual element and affectional needs in a long term and loving relationship. 
 
And the daily hardships that parental life face when raising kids. Looked at as a one size fits small (mind) pov of the illustrator.

That doesn't have to be a bad thing.|I wonder what that book actually is. I've seen it in a lot of memes.|> “These effects are often most visible when the structures of inequality take the most deeply internalized forms. **A constant staple of 1950s American situation comedies, for example, was jokes about the impossibility of understanding women. The jokes (always, of course, told by men) represented women’s logic as fundamentally alien and incomprehensible. One never had the impression the women in question had any trouble understanding men.** The reasons are obvious: women had no choice but to understand men; this was the heyday of a certain image of the patriarchal family, and women with no access to their own income or resources had little choice but to spend a great deal of time and energy understanding what their menfolk thought was going on. Hopefully, at this point, I do not have to point out that patriarchal arrangements of this sort are prima facie examples of structural violence; they are norms sanctioned by the threat of physical harm in endless subtle and not-so-subtle ways. **And this kind of rhetoric about the mysteries of womankind appears to be a perennial feature of them.** Generations of women novelists—Virginia Woolf comes most immediately to mind (e.g., Woolf 1927)—have also documented the other side of such arrangements: the constant efforts women end up having to expend in managing, maintaining, and adjusting the egos of oblivious and self-important men, involve a continual work of imaginative identification, or what I’ve called ‘interpretive labor.’ This carries over on every level. **Women are always expected to imagine what things look like from a male point of view. Men are almost never expected to reciprocate.** So deeply internalized is this pattern of behavior that many men react to the suggestion that they might do otherwise, as if it were an act of violence in itself.”

Noah and his family were the only ones who weren't totally evil, so they were chosen to build the ark and escape the floodwaters with several of each species of animal to repopulate the Earth once everything was said and done. Surviving the Flood was not a matter of recycling and reducing carbon emissions; it was a matter of obedience to His will. 




In contrast, with climate change, we CAN make a difference. It's a matter of stewardship and caring about the Earth that was created for us. The consequences we're seeing now in the environment are totally self-inflicted, and the cure will have to be as well.|Isn't this a shitpost?|Why did Noah build an Ark when he could have simply call Aquaman to take everyone in the Atlantis ?|I love pissing off creationist because they are stupid|Why did God tell Noah to save animals from a flood knowing full well that they'd just be hunted to extinction for their horns or fur?|I did chuckle at this tho |Because the big douchebag upstairs said he was going to genocide the planet and told Noah to get on it real quick.|idk why this is on terriblefacebookmemes when it's such blatant satire|Most people have aged, not grown up.|Two by two taxes were high back then|Or the fact he could just tell God to use his powers to snap away the so called evil doer's like Thanos without flooding the world and killing Animals who had nothing to do wrong.

As history has shown us, physically strong men are not the only ones needed to resist tyranny. In actuality, it normally tends to be physically strong men who become the tyrants in the first place.

You may not even be able to pay back the bank even if you have 0 fun.

The above is not a comment on how it SHOULD be, it's simply how it is. 

How it should be is essential things should never become unreasonable to pay (yes, education is essential). 

I do believe as a general practice it's best to learn to abstain from happiness until you've earned it, so in other words paying back your debts, taking care of responsibilities; this should not become unreasonable. 

I hold this belief because we don't live in a perfect world. In a perfect world we would have no needs as a society and infinite resources so you don't need to earn happiness, we do not live in that perfect world.

You would ask, wouldn't that make people suicidal? Why force anyone to live? Why isn't suicide the answer?

Good questions.

(Don't worry I'm fine, the answer is suicide is appealing, but can you really abandon everyone else in this imperfect world, not even try to fight the injustice of limited resources? Not try to improve the efficiency of the world, or at least improve/save the lives of others so they can live to become smart enough to see these truths? 

I can't.)|Can someone knock up a MAGA welfare recipients version, sadly the irony will be wasted.|$500+$500+$1500 = $30'000-$90'000|American Student loan system be like: 150000 debt, pays 100000, 140000 debt|if you think i'm buying a new phone every year instead of paying down my loans you're legitimately insane",terriblefacebookmemes,1gmtasw

There is no middle ground.|Beating your kids isn’t the way to teach them anything but avoiding your wrath. Not disciplining your kids leads to them treating others poorly and being a general cunt. You need to strike a balance, where you have control over situations like these, but not through fear of punishment and torment.|""I beat my kids lol""|Now a days.|His only hope was that the foot got so far up his ass, he drags them down to hell with him.|Omfg this one’s terrible|Shouts to the person fantasizing about beating the  muppet baby.|Gotta love abusive parents defending themselves.|Me when shoe in small intestine 😢|Bro if i said shut up mom i'd get into a lot of trouble too.

Had a principal in elementary who thought he could spank me, despite not having parents permission. He also liked blaming me, to the point he was in my face when leaving school with my sister. When I was bullied to the point other bullied kids were going after me. I even got to hear him say 'if you weren't so weird they wouldn't pick on you' in words most 10 year olds wouldn't understand. Turns out I was autistic and not diagnosed until my 30s. No wonder I was so weird even discounting the physical issue I had.

Also the last time my grandmother tried physically assaulting me it broke the spoon over my arm, and I was barely into double digits. She might have blamed me for a bunch of crap, thought I was going to die when I was born, but she never touched me again after that. Before I even knew what I was physically capable of because of what adrenaline does to my physiology, and likely does similar to any autistic person.   
  
It's a terrible meme but it's not exclusive to facebook, it's exclusive to anyone who doesn't want to admit spanking sucks, and that science has shown spanking doesn't work.

We still have all the Boomer's music and 4MPG ""muscle"" cars.  We have soda fountains that let us create custom combinations of flavors never before imagined (or just a Coke, if that's what we're in the mood for).  We can binge watch Happy Days on demand rather than needing to wait for next week's random rerun.  We even still have drive-ins, but they're more of a kitschy experience than a practical way to watch a movie.

Hell a lot of 90's economy cars like some V-Tech Civics could accelerate faster than some of them and if turns are involved the 90's Civic will definitely win.

Modern hypercars can go over 250 MPH, show me any car from before 2000 that can go those speeds that doesn't have a rocket in it.

- Drive in theaters, that honestly doesn't sound superior to modern theaters, it would also suck if you were in the back seat, trying to watch a movie. 

- Music, that's subjective as hell, that said as someone born in 1996 I actually do prefer 70's-80's music over today's but I still like todays

- We still have soda fountains even if they look boring now, and Coke's Freestyle machine is better than what they had back then.

Women by-and-large are often gonna be more sensitive to threats and negative emotions and men by-and-large less-so. This sensitivity provides an evolutionary advantage because threat detection is extremely important when raising children, which women often do. So, as a man, if your wife is feeling anxious about something, it's a good strategy to assume she's sensing something that you're not as tuned into. 

By assuming she's aware of a threat that you're not paying attention to, you can investigate why she's feeling that way through communicating with her and listening to what is upsetting her. Once you gather that information, you can use it to make a better informed decision on whether or not to take action to remove the threat or problem. Her threat detection system may not always be correct as it can produce false positives, but it's risky to ignore her completely cause she could be right about a serious threat that you're not attuned to, and it leaves her feeling terrible and you will pay a price for that.

A good metaphor is that women are like smoke detectors. If it's going off, it's foolish to assume it's wrong. You should go check cause you never know for sure if there's a fire or not until you do. If it's making that low battery sound, you got to take better care of it. If it makes 10 false positives a week, you should take a deeper look into the compnets so as to help repair it and help it work properly with you.|why does the minionette have boobs|I truly do not understand why some people especially older generations would gladly marrysomeone who has nothing in common with them as hobbies or interests and poor communication in a relationship,  I know this is a meme but it's such a stereotype for generations boomers and x|i like wife is always right memes. they're weirdly wholesome, they make me feel like they love there wives a lot.",terriblefacebookmemes,1g6qyvd

Like, he gives context and a bible verse that he's trying to teach, but everything is like this. It makes absolutely ZERO sense without the context, and only a little bit with it included.

And of course he has glowing reviews on his insta, many of which talk about how his comics are insightful and helpful, and even a totally real one from a non-religious person.

He's also apparently taking an open-ended time away to focus on health (probably got caught doing something bad).|What is there not to understand? I would definitely kill a dog for not understanding that he shouldn’t attack the chicken, even though I explained it to him in clear English|The dad called him a demon because he gets a dog. The dog is naturally aggressive and winds up biting a park ranger or something and is euthanized, and the parents are like ""we told you so"". Is this anti-dog propaganda?|God I hate this art style|I'm not saying it's good, but I feel like people in the comments are overcomplicating this.

Guy gets a dog who kills the chick.  The couple says you need to put that dog down, the guy says no, they say you're a demon for letting this dangerous dog walk around.  The guy then lets (seemingly dares lol) the dog commit several more aggressive acts, and *then* decides to put the dog down.  The couple then says he is a demon for killing his dog and the guy's like ""what the fuck, this is what you wanted""

Again I'm not saying it's right or has a clear message.  Idk if we're supposed to sympathize with the dog owner cus he at least gave the puppy a chance, ended up putting the dog down after exhausting his options, and still got guilted...Or if we're supposed to sympathize w the couple cus they're like we told you that dog was a problem and you let it do so much unnecessary damage before taking action.

It's a bad story, but I think those are its beats|Puppy kills chicken. Man demands he put it down. He refuses. Owner tries to train the dog. Dog does it again as an adult. Owner finally agrees to put it down. Owner is demonised for killing his dog by the Man who told him to.

I don't get the message either.|this comic was brought to you by Kristi Noem|I recognise the style. Aren't these normally modern reimaginings of bible parables?

Not sure which one this would be though...|This just makes me think of Kristi Noem shooting her young dog because it was too excitable (and did, in fact, kill some chickens). But...young dogs are like that. They get riled up easily and need time to mellow out and be properly trained. Yes, you need to be responsible for your dog, but the dog isn't inherently ""bad"" for going through this stage and doesn't deserve to die.|Most of his comics are Christian apologia. In this case, I think he's trying to point out that it's contradictory for people to criticize God for failing to put a stop to bad people before they have a chance to hurt good people, while simultaneously criticizing God for punishing people so harshly (i.e. with eternal damnation). They can't decide if they want God to do more or less and are criticizing God for giving people free will and a chance to correct their mistakes and become better people.

I don't think it really works, though: an all-knowing all-powerful God *could* give someone the option of doing evil and intervene before the innocent were hurt (like taking the chickens away the moment the dog shows signs of aggression). God doesn't seem to strike people down these days, and punishing someone after death in a place no mortal can see clearly isn't reducing harm. And unlike the dog owner, God controls everything including whatever neurological or abuse issues led to the dog being violent|Seems like the artist sides with Gov. Noem on slaughtering a dog for it not being trained right by her.|Kristi Noam’s made this.|Kill your dog it killed a bird

No that makes me a bad person

Teach dog not to kill bird

Dog kills bird

Angry at dog, sad bird owner

I killed dog

You are a bad person

Yeah, Whatever the point is, I don't fucking get it|If a dog is bad, you should euthanize it. I think that's what it is.|Puppy is too aggressive so the couple tells him it should be euthanized, he refuses and decides to teach the dog that chickens are friends but the dog actually is just too aggressive and just ends up killing the chickens anyway.  Farmer tries to stop the dog from killing the chickens and gets attacked as well resulting in the dog being put down for being too aggressive.  Couple then blames the guy for getting his dog killed.|At least the AI which drew it thinks it's funny|Is this some sorta damned if you do damned if you dont? Like, ""kill the dog"", ""no"", *dog mean af*, *forced to put dog dog*, ""how dare you put the dog down""|It’s obvious, dogs are evil because they follow their natural instinct of haunting 👿👿😡|My best guess is that this puppy is a violent psychopath And likes killing the twitter bird, so his... neighbors? Tell him to put it down, he says no, they call him evil. He tries to raise the dog not to be violent, but it obviously doesn't work, and he ends up attacking an old man who was trying to chase the weirdo handling his chickens and his psychotic dog away, so he had to put the dog down. The neighbors? Ask how it's going, and he says he had to put the dog down because it attacked the farmer. They call him evil for killing the dog for being a dog.",terriblefacebookmemes,1g0o8ty

It's one of those things my dad taught me long ago.  A quick google search says it can be traced back to the medieval era, and knight behavior.  It's a tradition that's pretty much gone away in the current age, and no, I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  It's something I've always thought was kind of pointless.

  
So, i'm not sure where someone gets angry at wearing it a table specifically when the tradition was ""indoors"", it sort of already covered.

  
but, it's something that will pretty much vanish completely when people my age are gone /shrug|That’s certainly how I was raised. I don’t practice it at my table though.

But I respect the rules of those whose table I’m eating at.|Well I feel like it’s home to home. Is it rude in her house? Well it’s not in mine. It’s her home so she can think what she wants to.|I mean, I sorta agree with this, because I was brought up that hats aren't for indoors.

The amount of clearly Christian westerners doing what, to them, was respectful - I.e. removing their hats - and all the staff rushing around gesturing them to put the hat back in and cover their head, which was what _they_ considered respectful. Everyone complied, if somewhat confusedly.

But yeah, you just do what is considered good manners in the house you're in. If you're at MILs and she asks you to take your hat off - and you don't, you're a dick. If MIL comes to your house and gets offended you're wearing a hat in your own house at your own table, _she's_ a dick.|It is rude in the sense that you are willing to ignore other’s traditions and social customs.|In Russia, wearing a hat indoors is rude. It's mostly tied in with how our religion had this rule where hats at home was heresy, and women should wear a napkin around their head, so that kinda stuck and now hats at table is rude.

there is a “worst of both worlds” driver. that is the person who zooms down the empty right lane AND THEN PICKS AN ARBITRARY TIME TO PUT ON THEIR BLINKER, STOP AND MERGE even if there is no space between the two chosen vehicles, thereby ALSO BLOCKING THE RIGHT LANE.|Zipper is great. But can we all acknowledge that you only zipper when traffic is stop/start. I can’t stand people that go like 20 over to pass a bunch of moving vehicles because they want to be first. You had all the opportunity to get over like the rest of us but that wasn’t fast enough for you.|Zipper merging only works if everyone knows what zipper merging is. 

Millions of US drivers are still taught to get over as soon as they see a sign indicating a merge ahead and don't even know what zipper merging is. The problem is a lack of consistent education.|Southern Boomers HATE the concept of zipper merge and act like it's another Yankee tool of oppression being foisted upon us. I know they understand the concept, however, because I've seen them all participate in it willingly in the Chick-fil-A drive through.|No one zipper merges correctly because over half of them think that by letting even a single car ahead of them is going to delay their travel by an hour or something. It's always ego driven.|Mostly yes, but if i see you accelerate into the right lane to pass a few cars before the lane closes, then you are waiting my impatient friend.|""The only smart drivers are the ones driving exactly like me""|The problem is that hardly anyone will zipper merge, so you wind up with this wide-open lane and anyone that drives down it is automatically considered an asshole.|Zipper merge only works if all drivers are considerate. Those assholes will pass 4 drivers waiting to let them over so they can get over at the last minute. Hell yeah I’m going to make them wait. 

And also fuck you if you let 5 people over and hold up traffic.|I honestly didn’t even know what a zipper merge was until a trip to California where a friend had to explain it to me, because I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago where no one let anyone in, ever… 

My entire family would yell and say that they are not letting someone in because they didn’t merge sooner. My entire life, I believe that you were supposed to merge as soon as you saw the sign and that people who waited until the last minute were just trying to get a couple of car lengths ahead and holding up traffic. 

It’s literally how we learn to drive in Chicago. 

I swear to God, Chicago has the worst drivers in the world. 🤦🏻‍♀️|In my city, this guy would actually be going the speed of light down the lane with closed signs a mile back. This may be the case here. If it is, fuck that guy the boomer has a point. If the lane change really is just what we see, then yeah zipper.|Honestly it depends for myself. If they're aggressively trying to merge after the fact, by getting really close to the vehicles and honking or just being a douche, then no, I'm not letting you in. Now, if it's somebody who's just sitting there, waiting patiently for an opening. Then yeah, I'm gonna let that person in. I think it honestly kind of depends on the situation and how the person who needs to merge is reacting to the fact that they need to merge..|If it’s one of those two lane exits where one goes north and one goes south and the north of is backed up a ways but the south one is clear, if I see you get approach the end of the north line, move to the open lane, then try to get into the north line way ahead, you’re not getting let in.

Basically, there’s plenty of instances where they were clearly trying to avoid the line|Most people don't... since my office did return to work (I work in IT so I was in everyday anyway) I've noticed that there has been a new accident every day in the same merge points.  I also noticed most people don't grasp the idea of a zipper merge.  Sad times man.... on that note I wonder if there is a way for me to figure out if my office forcing these idiots to come back has directly caused these accidents lmao.|This driver knew the lane was ending, decided to make it everyone else's problem trying to avoid having to wait in traffic like everyone else.

This driver doesn't put the grocery cart back, rewind their tapes, wash their hands after the bathroom, and probably has whole ass conversations on speakerphone with people in public.

I hope they never get let in, pure childish anti-social behavior|Yeah, the problem here is zipper merge has been shown scientifically to be the best way, but socially, it's obnoxious. 

If everyone defaulted to a zipper merge it wouldn't be, but we don't, so it's viewed as a violation of the social contract of ""wait your turn in line like everyone else"". I mean, can you imagine using a zipper merge waiting in line for a checkout at a store? The same logic should work there, but it'd probably result in fights in that context.|Yes because everyone knows it's far more efficient for everyone to panic and merge like 2 miles before the lane ends leaving one lane totally unused.

The problem arises when ppl put down/shame others for having too high of a body count or too low of a body count/being a virgin.|If their body count is higher than their age, then I'm concerned. But moreso because this means they likely dedicate a slightly significant amount of their free time to pursuing sex with others. Which is not something I can relate to. I wouldn't even say that's a hard number for me, just a general guideline. It's more about how they choose to spend their time, and their judgement then it is anything to do with the physical act of sex.|It’s true, most of us don’t want to deal with a serial killer.|Again, much like the internet, nuance is lost. 

If you do not want to date a broke man, or a “short” man,    that is your preference due to your history of dating hobosexuals or you didn’t like the height difference between you and the SO. Just don’t hate on men who are those things. 

Same with men. If you don’t want to date a woman with kids, or she’s had many sexual partners, then they don’t want you as their girlfriend. The problem is that they just LOATHE women who do it as if women are a hive mind and if a woman sees another woman being promiscuous, then ofc their woman will be and they will lose. 

Set your expectations and boundaries, and if that specific person doesn’t meet them consistently, then move on. Don’t make someone’s life shameful because you don’t want to date them.|If jobs, hobbies or family are of interest then body count might also be too|Most fellow modern men I know don't care (not saying the ones that do don't exist but really most I meet don't these days).

Then the abortion bans came and the fact checkers were mothers who died cause they couldn’t get abortions 😎|Big IF true!|I don't think that's what happened.|Archaeological evidence has proven that the Noah's flood story was plagiarized from the Epic of Gilgamesh, a flood story which was written 1000 years before the Bible, not to mention that story was also plagiarized from an even earlier story, the Epic of Atra Hasis which was also plagiarized from an earlier story Ziusudra. There is clear evidence which stories were written first and which were a later adaptations. And the rest of the flood stories from around the world just happened to be from civilizations that used to flood occasionally and had a very different narrative.
We have living trees that date back over 9000 years. Not only does that predate the biblical estimate of the age of the Earth of 6000 years, it shows that the flood never happened approximately 4370 years ago as creationist websites claim.. How can a tree survive underwater for an entire year? 
Not to mention that major civilizations like the Egyptians and the Chinese were in existence before the suppose flood and yet amazingly enough were not affected by it nor mentioned it. 
We have hundreds of thousands of anual ice core layer samples from Antarctica and Greenland that corroborate each other. These layers are analysed and dated using multiple scientific methods other than just counting layers. Even dendrochronology (the scientific method of dating tree rings to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history) is used to corroborate and calibrate the ice core layers up to 15,000 years. The analysis of the ice cores accurately show all major climate events throughout its history. It shows the last iceage approximately 11,000 years ago. It even shows the volcanic eruption of Pompeii back in 79AD. And it definitely shows no sign of a worldwide flood in the last 20,000 years.
There's also the problem of specialized diets of the animals. Take the Koalas from Australia. Lets disregard it's impossibility to get to the ark let alone a sloth from South America getting there. Evidence shows for the last 50,000 years koalas have lived on a strict diet of fresh eucalyptus leaves and will only eat fresh leaves off a branch. That's one major problem right there. A lot of animals need fresh specialized food, specialized climate and habitat to survive which is impossible on an ark for an entire year.
Another problem with the flood myth is the fossil record. It is not conceivable that a worldwide flood would bury (and instantly fossilize) all types of plants and animals in discrete layers everywhere in the world, in a pattern indicating descent with modification. Similarly, a global flood would not produce fossil tracks, animal burrows, leaf impressions and entire forests at various levels in the same geological column. If all plants and animals were created at the same time, then destroyed in a global flood, the resulting fossils (if any) would be randomly distributed. The geological distribution of animals world wide match where their evolutionary fossil records are found and not from an epicentre from Noah's Ark.

While I'm here I may as well destroy the Bible entirely. 

With Genetics, Mitochondrial DNA shows that the human population has never gone down below 3,000 individuals in the last 200,000 years, let alone a population of 8 which was Noah and his family approximately 4370 years ago. This fact also destroys the Adam and Eve fairytale. Without the Adam and Eve story, there would be no 'Original Sin'. Without original sin there will be no need for Jesus, the Christian religion falls apart completely.

The whole religion is based on and relies on a story that could not possibly be true.

How the fuck did Noah, without books with photographs or the internet, find and sex every single animal on the planet?

Uninteresting study|True tbh 

Most people over here don't know about the Indian middle class culture but let me tell you something.

Poor and rich people are having their best life out here, poor people get free rations and health care by the government, and also don't have to pay any taxes, on the other hand rich people live their life yk how.

Most Indian parents will FORCE and by FORCE I MEAN FORCE their child to become a engineer or doctor which leads to high pressure and student suicide rate.

Middle class is also the Highest tax payer in the country as poor people don't pay taxes and rich avoid the taxes by creating loopholes. Even after paying almost 60% in taxes we get facilities like afghanistan, as the government is highly corrupt and uneducated.

A person who wants to have more money (in this case the ""rich person"") will spend those $1000 on something that will save them more money in the long run. Like investments, solid equipment that won't break down, paying off debt, preventative car repairs, dental work, a costco membership fee, high quality essentials that last and so on and so forth. A person who gets $1000 and wants to spend it on something that is considered a status symbol but won't last very long (in this example, the iPhone), then they will risk still being stuck in the financial status they are in.

$100,000 may be an over exaggeration, but if you think long term on those things you spend a lot of money on, then it will save you a lot more than what you were previously spending. Like with the car repair example I gave... let's say if you spend $1000 on many oil changes on your car versus not doing it at all.

To save money, the new pipeline was not finished and they decided to use Flint River water, which was corrosive.  To save a few more million per year, they decided to forego an additive in the water that would have prevented the leaching and corrosion.

First panel: okay yeah, that’s fair, but I actually think we can be a little more flexible on this one. I mean it’s kinda selfish to want a two story house all to yourself, unless— oh, wait, there’s more…

Second panel: oh. It’s that kind of meme. Yes, living the dream by having a wife who loves you because you can \*checks note\* read an unmarked blue book. Okay maybe I am being a bit too harsh here, sometimes English is not easy, and I’m a native speaker, for all I know this guy is from somewhere in Europe other than the UK, so I apologize about being critical of his reading ability. As long as he is enjoying it as much as he seems to be, I guess.

Third panel: alright, I stand corrected on the original comment about his reading comprehension skills, I am fairly certain that a firearm is a really bad idea to use in lieu of utensils. I’m not trying to shit on the second amendment, it just seems like the smart thing to stick in your mouth ISN’T the gun, unless you literally intend to eat lead. Pro tip: don’t do that. It’s really freaking painful and you will probably be in a closed casket at the resulting funeral. I will admit, you are ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy. Wait, did he change his shirt before digging into the meal with his gun utensils? 

Fourth panel: uh… something ain’t right here. He ate his food… before he cooked it? I guess he is just that hungry. And he changed his shirt again. I’m not even surprised by this now, but I am surprised at the absolute level of GLARE this man is suddenly capable of. Speaking of the shirt though, I am disappointed in your lack of imagination. No taxes? That’s it? I am torn between apologizing again for the insensitivity towards reading ability, and chewing this guy the F### out for being so flavorless in his message. If this is one of the tax hating people who thinks that “no taxes” is a good enough punchline, then I am very sorry for your mental health. Have some class, please. If you need to be anti-taxation, be SERIOUS and FIERCE about it. Make the person who sees your shirt go “okay, sure… wait whatdidthatshirtsay OH. Oh. Oh damn…” make sure you get their attention immediately and don’t just drop the ball before they get hooked. Also, if you thought having guns near your mouth was bad, wait until you hear about what happens when you have them near a propane tank. Wasn’t that a scene in one of the Final Destination movies? I have a feeling that that was actually a scene, it might not have had a gun, but it was perfect for an example.

There’s reaching for an abstract conclusion and then there’s absurdity 😂|Well, yeah. That's predominantly the ""*kids nowadays!! Phones bad!! Let's write in cursive to confuse the young idiots!!*"" crowd. They know they're being made obsolete, their culture and way of life isn't something they can share with the youth, they don't get to have their grandparent moment where they're finally above the struggles of youth culture, and can therefore reap the benefits of mastering their culture and customs of their generation. Instead, the world just moved on and forgot about them, told them their way of life was useless, everything's done digitally now. When you grow old, you become invisible. And if you can't cut it and keep up with technology, you might as well live in a cave.

This will happen to us, too. When we think we have it figured out it won't matter. When we think we've mastered the ropes, we'll be in the same boat. Maybe irony will have poisoned culture too much for us to even really care about it when it comes time to. I'm 27, btw. It's not our fault that life moved on too quickly for them to catch up, or that there was yet another thing they had to master before settling into the grandparent generation, or that their way of life was made obselete. Hell, even our generation knows how quickly things progressed, even before cyber-bullying laws were brought in we had to figure out what cyber-bullying even was, and we lost a lot of young people to suicide because the support just wasn't there for us, but definitely not in our wild-west era. We wouldn't have accepted adequate support even if it was handed to us on a platter. We grew up with fast-moving technology, and for the most part, we did it by ourselves. 

We can't blame old people for being bitter on the internet and crying about how the world is changing too fast. We literally moved on without giving them the chance to sing the song they spent their whole life learning, turns out nobody cares. And this WILL happen to us.

Definitely not in line with inflation

And bands went from reasonably priced 15k seater arenas to 100k stadiums charging a fortune and making millions on a tour.|I looked this up because of course I did. In 1975 it cost $12 to see the Rolling Stones' ""Tour of the Americas,"" which amusingly ended up only hitting the United States and Canada. That's equivalent to $69 today. The Stones just ended a tour and apparently tickets (I assume very bad seats) were going for as low as $74 in Los Angeles. So the difference isn't really as much as people think it is. Of course, your huge cultural events like the Taylor Swift tour are going to be significantly more expensive, but the Stones are still a huge touring act in their 80s (their last tour was the 10th highest-grossing concert tour of all time), and their fans have more money to burn, so I don't think it's a bad comparison.

Also they look good and this is gross to shame them for being slightly larger than they were.|So the joke is that when they put convenient junk food right next to our work place, we are gonna eat it and gain weight….
