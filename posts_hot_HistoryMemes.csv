In practice it was always about slavery) until the emancipation proclamation 2 years into the war to force neutrality from foreign powers

Before that. Everybody basically viewed the union the same way they viewed the confederacy. Rebel states|Don’t forget the Czar supported the Union and sent the Russian Navy to help defend East and West coast as well.|There’s a timeline where imperial Russian Streltsy and Italian Redshirts fought side by side for freedom and Union. We were robbed of that|555!|Why is a Napoleonic Polish Lancer depicted here?

Man, that is something really nice.|Lincoln did not need help to defeat the South, but was primarily concerned with outside intervention. It would have been relatively easy to handle any Old World intervention given the introduction of coastal ironclads (getting these early designs through the choppy Atlantic was out of question) providing regional naval superiority, but no intervention was certainly simpler. As such he firmly declared any recognition of the South would be considered an act of war, in clear warning to France and Britain.

*Imperial* Russia and Prussia were the powers that ensured Britain and France remained neutral over the matter.

Russia like the US stood opposed to France and Britain, for the Russians ever since the Crimean War. Something they were still fuming over.

For the US the lingering sentiment against Britain from the Revolutionary and then War of 1812 led to rather frosty to downright hostile relations until Britain began submitting to American oil in the 1890s (Open Door Policy.) It was similarly against France for aligning with Britain and then violating the Monroe Doctrine with their invasion of Mexico.

Prussia meanwhile was a historical rival to France, competing for influence amongst German states along the Rhine.

They needed little reason to join on the side of the US.

It would not be a surprise if British and French recognition leads to Russia and Prussia joining the side of the US, kickstarting the Franco Prussian War five years earlier and turning the ""Great Game"" between Britain and Russia from a cold war to a hot one, with India on the line.

Lincoln seeing European powers say ""not our problem mate"" was ideal, though he very likely still would have been on the winning side had Europe intervened.|Tis a great delight to march and fight as a New York Volunteer!",HistoryMemes,1icennu
2,The genuine audacity of Portugal to even mention that in the BERLIN CONFERENCE,https://i.redd.it/j7sfx2p5isfe1.jpeg,6792,2025-01-29 01:30:35,87,"Short and simplified explanation:

The Berlin Conference was a meeting of European colonial powers to negotiate which parts of Africa each of them should get. In this meeting, Portugal used the Treaty of Tordesillas, a treaty made hundreds of years prior to the conference that seperated the entire world between Portugal and Spain after the discovery of the Americas where Portugal was given the entirety of Africa, to justify the absurd amount of African territory they wanted.

Just like how the Treaty of Tordesillas wasn't taken very seriously, this obviously didn't work for them, but at least they did actually get some land.

Also, I'm aware that France claimed more than just West Africa in the Berlin Conference too.|Fun fact!

America was there too.

Spain, France, and Italy crying in the corner.|Yeah this is a misrepresentation of the conference. European powers didn't all get together and negotiate African frontiers, they just set up rules. Belgium didn't even ask for the Congo, Leopold did that himself and the bulk of the Congo negotiations were actually centred around American interests.|Wasn't the Congo given to Belgium to keep great powers from having it, rather than them asking for it?|Belgian Congo was hands-off for Portugal.|Under the pope's authority, you say? You mean the guy who rage-quit the world and imprisoned himself in the Vatican? Who cares about that loser?|Portugal literally only asked for the Pink Map but OK keep coping because you guys wanted to give the Congo to the one colonist who somehow scared even all the other imperialists|Belgium didn't show up saying they wanted the Congo

3,All in,https://i.redd.it/0zjbjxpn3sfe1.jpeg,6735,2025-01-29 00:03:56,63,"13 hours before the Challenger disaster, Morton-Thiokol Incorporated engineer Roger Boisjoly and three of his colleagues tuned into a three-way teleconference between them, the Marshall Spaceflight Center, and the Kennedy Space Center to discuss concerns of air temperature during the next day’s planned launch. Boisjoly cited the previous January’s launch of STS-51-C as evidence that the rubber O-rings meant to seal the solid rocket booster joints would not work as intended in frigid temperatures. 51-C was notable for being the coldest shuttle launch ever prior to the Challenger disaster at just 12 degrees Celsius. Post-recovery inspection of the right SRB revealed that the first O-ring around the midsection field joint had come within a *millimeter* of burning through. 

Boisjoly’s colleagues implored NASA that the launch be postponed until temperatures were above at least 53 degrees fahrenheit. NASA officials strongly declined, knowing that O-ring damage had occurred on numerous flights prior with no major consequences. However, multiple delays and external pressure from the government and press was the bigger reason for their hesitancy. The Thiokol team left the call to take an offline vote.

The Thiokol team was made up of 4 engineers and 4 managers, all of which would have voted “no” on launching had it not been for the pressure from NASA. MTI rejoined the call with NASA, and although all 4 engineers still voted “no”, all 4 managers voted to launch and excluded the engineers from a final vote because, in the words of MTI general manager Jerry Mason in front of the Rogers Commission investigating the disaster later that year “We knew they didn’t want to launch. We had listened to their reasons and emotions, but in the end we had to make a management decision.” NASA asked if there were objections, and hearing none, decided to launch Challenger on mission STS-51-L the next morning.

EDIT: the January 1985 launch was 51-C, not 51-D.|I know that this is for Challenger, but this is very similar to the issue that Boeing had with starliner.|I also love how this is now a mandatory story you hear in every Engineering Ethics class, but Management and Business classes gloss over it despite the fact that the Engineers were correct all along, but it was the Management who ignored all their warnings.|I am Impressive you made this meme on the exact 39th year memorial.|“Truth, Lies, & O-Rings” by Allan McDonald (Director of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor Project at Morton Thiokol) is excellent.|The shuttle was a management disaster from the start with how many changes they had to make from the original project.

[The Space Shuttle: A $200 Billion Lesson in Risk Management](https://youtu.be/MShnWhUGqHw?si=7-HH0Oa393kLgNat)

Specifically starting at 18:30, he talks a lot about the loss of Challenger. 

TL;DR;Imperfect recollection- The common narrative of the meeting before where Thiokol recommended postponement is simplified to the point of being wrong. Thiokol’s engineers requested a specific review, which is set up as an adversarial process. Typically it was contractors making their case to NASA that the flight SHOULD take place and NASA taking the stance that it SHOULDN’T, but in this case, it was flipped. Thiokol, also somewhat thrown for a loop by this turn of events, didn’t have adequate evidence to make their case that the risk was that severe, so the position NASA was defending won and the flight continued. 

Of note, Thiokol didn’t believe that a flight would DEFINITELY result in the loss of the ship, only that it would unduly increase the risk, and their statement of the case didn’t convince NASA that the risk increase was sufficient to delay, ergo, the flight continued. 

Also of note, everyone on both the NASA side and the Thiokol side of the call were engineers. It wasn’t engineers pleading with management that the flight was doomed, it was engineers saying to other engineers they thought the risk was too great, and the other engineers saying they disagreed and maintaining the existing schedule. 

That’s not to say that NASA was blameless, the review process definitely had to be- and was- improved. It’s just to say that when we remember and honour the lost crew of Challenger, instead of picturing hapless engineers pressured into decisions by devious politicians, we should be picturing people trapped by a flawed system of bureaucracy which wasn’t flexible enough to handle the edge case that was found. Moreover, we should remember that our systems, too, may not be designed to evaluate risks from all angles, and those of us involved in safety-critical roles (like myself) have a duty remember that our processes may be similarly flawed, and try to ensure that our concerns are well stated and the concerns of those working with us are well received.|Those O rings were also made by Mormon minors.|Did someone mention o-rings? (Insert ERIKS logo)|Just listened to the season of American Scandal on this. Made me so upset as I was listening to it.|They didn't want to keep delaying the mission despite not being safe. Hence, the resulting disaster.|can someone tell me the meme base?|we went over this case in my technical communications class. one of the big things our professor highlighted to us was the lack of direct language and how the engineers could have worded their memos better in order to better communicate the severity of this issue. in the internal docs we studied, they never explicitly say that the launch needs to be pushed back. they only “recommend” and “advise” it be pushed back. and while another engineer reading that would think “we gotta delay the launch” management sees that as “we should delay the launch but it’s not totally necessary” 


anyways that’s why we take technical communications and ethics in engineering classes. so you can explain to your boss who has no idea what you do why they should do what you say.|Noice",HistoryMemes,1ic8kb0

Heresies everywhere.,https://i.redd.it/aa23iumrbrfe1.jpeg,10213,2025-01-28 21:27:35,109,"I mean, it's also important to note that the current perception of interpreting the Bible or issues like the nature of Christ or the Holy Trinity differently (and potentially being ""wrong"") is not the same as it was centuries ago, after all these are issues that, from a believer's perception, if you are wrong you are putting the salvation of your immortal soul at risk and by seeking to get others to adhere to your ideas, you are doing the same with them, thus ""diverting the path"" of these people.

And in most cases the hatred was reciprocal, the disparity would come mostly from the power of each movement compared to the beliefs already established as majority (or that would end up being so)|It should be said that medieval heresies were generally not harshly persecuted until they led to political unrest. For instance, Lollardism was tolerated and even supported by many English nobles until the peasant's revolt of 1381. Similarly, the Cathars (whose beliefs were vastly wildly more divergent than a ""slight interpretation"" difference) were sent largely peaceful missionaries for \~80 years until the murder of Pierre de Castelnau in 1208.

In fact it was Late Antiquity, not the medieval era, which saw the greatest intolerance over tiny differences. The Byzantine oppression of the Copts, who really did have a minute disagreement, was so brutal that they actively welcomed the Muslim invasions. By the medieval era Chalcedonian and Oriental Christians largely got along again.|People think medieval heretics are like the top picture because they don’t know what heresy is.

5,When the resistance was using the catacombs,https://i.redd.it/fhcwqbf5crfe1.png,6427,2025-01-28 21:30:49,42,"I mean the catacombs of Paris are not the safest place to be , with no actual maps or lights in place and the supports keeping the roof a roof really not designed to work for this long or to have a city built over them....|The catacombs of Paris are enveloped in legends, largely due to their eerie, macabre atmosphere and the labyrinthine tunnels that crisscross beneath the city. One popular myth suggests that during World War II, the French Resistance made extensive use of these catacombs. In  reality, The tunnels were not fully explored or interconnected, which made navigation beneath the city challenging. Rather than serving as a primary thoroughfare, the catacombs were more commonly used to hide weapons, equipment, and personnel.

  
In 1943, a medical student named René Suttel discovered ancient ruins beneath Sainte-Anne Hospital. He shared this secret with Henri Rol-Tanguy, the leader of the ""Région P1"" (Paris 1) of the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). This discovery led to the establishment of a crucial command post for the Resistance. Located under Place Denfert-Rochereau, this underground space was transformed into a bunker. It was  connected to parts of the catacomb network, providing a strategic base from which to orchestrate operations. This command post, known as the PC Rol-Tanguy, became instrumental during the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, serving as the nerve center where leaders coordinated their efforts to free the city from German control.

  
[You can see photos of the ruins of the old PC here](http://explorationurbaine.com/pc-rol-tanguy-labri-ffi-dans-les-catacombes-de-paris/) and a[ video](https://youtu.be/9f76FRNsSuc?si=BVIP9eFzMXdIxDFx)|The résistance were not the only one trying to make warfare use of the catacombs.

Arizona collided with the iceberg head-on at full speed, which crushed its nose. Stephen Guion, the company owner was on the ship, instead of firing the crew, he used the accident to promote how safe his liners were.

And indeed, Guion liners was so safe, that most of the people who died in an incident that involve Guion liners were the one those liners collided into... The company had around 10 passengers or crews died onboard of their liners during critical sinking moments.

Unfortunately, the negotiations did not lead to much and both countries mobilized troops to strategic points on the border in the far south.
Eventually, the Vatican acted as a mediator and resolved the conflict in 1984.

In 2002, the murderers of Eugenio Berrios, Pinochet's chief chemist, were put on trial in Chile.
During the trial, one of the murderers revealed that Berrios suggested to Pinochet poisoning the water supplies in Buenos Aires with sarin gas and botulinum toxin in case Argentina attacked Chile.

Berrios bragged that the chemicals he designed could kill everyone in Buenos Aires in less than 2 hours|Why is it always Argentina with some rocks in the sea?|""Fun"" fact: Argentinian armored columns were actually on their way to cross the border and commence hostilities when, on December 24th, 1978, the Pope himself intervened to prevent bloodshed. 

Whereas Argentina's force was better equipped and had more armored vehicles, the Chilean forces had mobilized about 140k men. It had become a solid infantry army, and one that would make the Argentinians pay in blood for every inch of land taken. 

Chilean commandos had infiltrated past Argentinian lines, and carried with them more chemical weapons to poison the water supplies of Argentinian troops. The would disguise themselves as cattle drivers, and their plan was to dissipate in 4 or 5 man teams and just cause mayhem.

Also, mind you, this whole fuckup was a consequence of Argentina (as per usual), disregarding an international arbitration that decided sovereignty of the islands for Chile. Argentina at the time was really, _really_ hawkish country.

Also, Patagonia's claims were always conflictual between the two States.

It would've taken less time to read the man's wiki article than to make that shit meme.|Context by chatgpt:

This meme refers to Ignaz Semmelweis, a 19th-century Hungarian physician who discovered that handwashing significantly reduced maternal deaths in hospitals.

Explanation:
	1.	The image is a variation of the “Wojak” meme, where one character (a doctor with bloody hands) is angrily shouting, “I F***ING HATE YOU AND HOPE YOU DIE!”
	2.	The other character, labeled Semmelweis, calmly says, “Wash your hands.”

Historical Context:
	•	In the mid-1800s, Semmelweis noticed that doctors who performed autopsies and then delivered babies without washing their hands had much higher rates of puerperal (childbed) fever in maternity wards.
	•	He introduced handwashing with a chlorine solution, which dramatically reduced mortality rates.
	•	However, the medical community at the time rejected his findings, considering them an insult to their expertise. Many doctors mocked him, leading to his eventual downfall.

Meme’s Meaning:

The meme humorously highlights how Semmelweis was hated for simply suggesting basic hygiene, despite being correct. The doctor with bloody hands represents the ignorant medical professionals who resisted his ideas.

This concept is now known as the Semmelweis Reflex, where people reject new knowledge that contradicts established beliefs.",HistoryMemes,1ibinxn

37,The New York State Assemblyman’s Riot of 1882 was quite chaotic.,https://i.redd.it/ok0sct5epjfe1.jpeg,13283,2025-01-27 19:49:47,65,"Aight buckle up because this is a long one. This entire ordeal is, simply put, my favorite story of Theodore Roosevelt. 

Having just been elected to the New York State Assembly at the ripe old age of 23, Theodore Roosevelt brought with himself a moral vigor that granted him as many friends as it did enemies. He saw the assembly as an arena for combat, and wasn’t afraid to stubbornly stand by something if he believed it to be good as opposed to evil. At the time, Albany was considered to be a hotbed of corruption, “a cesspool of manifold iniquity”, and it clashed with Roosevelt, a rich kid mind you, genuinely giving a damn about the poor and downtrodden. If there were figures who were professionals at corruption, then it’d be the infamous “Black Horse Cavalry”, party legislatures who made politics a business for trading favors of all sorts. It got so bad that sometimes, an assemblyman would give an impassioned speech against a vile bill, only to vote in favor once a “benefactor” graced the assemblyman’s coffers. 

Enter one [Jay Gould](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Gould), an unscrupulous businessman that put other such men to shame. Already in control of the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Western Union Telegraph Company, the professional stock-jobber set his sights on  Manhattan Elevated, the premier elevated train service in all of the East Coast. Gould utilized the New York World (one of his own newspapers) to badmouth Manhattan Elevated in order to drive down stock prices. He then promptly bought enough shares of the company to effectively control it, with said shares then instantly doubling in price once the news dropped. To add insult to injury, Gould flagrantly adopted a public-be-damned attitude, which pissed off Roosevelt in particular. Now, Manhattan Elevated was shackled with quite the hefty tax burden, and Gould moved quick to rectify such a glaring issue. He got some “legal advisors” to amend a random & innocuous bill so that it remitted 1/3rd of the taxes paid by elevated lines. The plot was to introduce the bill at the end of the assembly session, so that it could be passed without anyone really paying attention. 

UNFORTUNATELY, one Mike Costello, a staunch ally of Roosevelt (even though he was a Democrat of Tammany Hall) checked on the bill as it made its way from the assembly to the senate. As he went to alert Roosevelt, the corrupt speaker pro tempore hurriedly brought the bill out to be read and voted on. Costello, who was in an adjoining room as this went down, promptly bolted to the assembly floor and launched a filibuster. The speaker in turn repeatedly slammed his gavel, demanding that Costello be still. When he refused, the speaker ordered the sergeant at arms to arrest him. As the officer was complying, Roosevelt then raced into the chamber and picked up right where Costello had left off. Chaos ensued, and as jeering, retorts, and overall bedlam overtook the assembly, the speaker furiously declared that the measure had passed and would be sent to the Governor. 

The news of the riot spread like wildfire, and the harsh spotlight of public scrutiny destroyed the amendment. Roosevelt & Costello were instantly famous, though Costello was punished by his Tammany Hall handlers and forced out of the assembly as a result. “I spoke with the greatest emphasis, stating and showing beyond doubt that the bill was a steal, and the motives of its supporters dishonest.” In a life of rough riding, sailing down treacherous rivers, and being the President, the story of the then 23-year old tagging in to back up his Tammany ally to destroy an insidious bill sits out in particular to me. Before he was famous, he fought for what he believed was right, damned the consequences. This is technically part 1 of a two parter, as Gould’s response to the entire situation merits a meme on its own, and I simply couldn’t fit it all into this one post.

He is one of the finest military minds. He fought across the sub-continent and won more than 22 battles against the opponents of Adil Shah Suri. Hemu claimed royal status as a **king** after defeating Akbar's Mughal forces on 7 October 1556 in the Battle of Delhi. He took possession of Delhi and assumed the title of Vikramaditya. Hemu’s (now called *Raja Hemchandra Vikramaditya*) reign would be short-lived as he would again clash with the Mughals only a month later. 

Elsewhere, on hearing the disastrous news about losing Delhi in a battle, Young Akbar immediately set off for Delhi from Tughlaqabad. The Mughal army was led by Akbar, under the guidance of his regent Bairam Khan. On 5 November 1556, the Mughal Army met Hemu's army at the historic **second battle of Panipat**. 

Hemu led his army into battle atop an elephant named *Hawai*. It was a desperately contested battle, but… due to his strong leadership and tactical acumen, the advantage tilted in favor of Hemu. Both the wings of the Mughal army had been driven back, and Hemu moved his contingent of war elephants and cavalry forward to crush their center. Hemu was on the *cusp of victory* when a Mughal arrow struck Hemu in the eye, severely wounding him and causing him to collapse unconscious. Seeing their leader incapacitated, Hemu's soldiers panicked. This broke their formation, which weakened the cohesion of his army. They began to scatter. The Mughal forces exploited this chaos, decisively defeating Hemu's army. The elephant carrying the wounded Hemu (who, BTW, is still alive) was captured and led to the Mughal camp. Bairam Khan asked the 13-year-old Akbar to behead Hemu. Hemu's head was sent to Kabul while his body was gibbeted on a gate in Delhi. 

Mughals took the spoils from the battle at Panipat, which included 120 of Hemu's war elephants. Their destructive rampages impressed the Mughals so much that the animals soon became integral to their military strategies. With the passing of Hemu, Adil Shah's fortunes took a turn for the worse, and he was killed in 1557. 

Hemu’s execution marked the *consolidation of Mughal power under Akbar* in northern India. This battle was significant because it ensured the ***survival*** and expansion of the Mughal Empire, setting the stage for Akbar's long and illustrious reign.

Image Source: [Click here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQkmPlnBf7J/)|It wouldn't have been the dawn of his sovereignty over the Mughals. It would have been probably the end of Mughal ambitions on north India for quite some time, possibly until Akbar recuperated and regrouped or the whole lot just pulling back to Kabul and establishing a state there instead. Hemu would have inaugurated his sovereignty over north India instead, and there's no solid way to judge how that would have gone because it was Akbar's military victories and political choices that helped establish the Mughal empire.

# A HERETIC?""|My favorite anecdote about the Showa Emperor: 

""On September 5, 1941, Hirohito received an outline for Japanese plans for war or peace. Hirohito was outraged that the war option was presented before the peace option. Hirohito demanded that the chief of staff of the army, Sugiyama, and chief of staff of the navy, Nagano, appear before him that day and explain themselves.

At that meeting Sugiyama assured Hirohito that the war would be won in a few months time. Growing angry, Hirohito reminded Sugiyama that he had said the same thing about how long it would take to win a war with China, and that was 4 years ago, and no end to that war was in sight. Hirohito scolded him, ""You say the interior of China is huge; isn't the Pacific Ocean even bigger than China? Didn't I caution you each time about those matters? Sugiyama, are you lying to me?""

Admiral Nagano told a trusted colleague, ""I have never seen the Emperor reprimand us in such a manner, his face turning red and raising his voice.""  *Hirohito's War: The Pacific War 1941-1945* by Francis Pike.|I mean a bit oversimplified, the mid level officers felt that the Emperor was being manipulated by greedy and untrustworthy government officials and tricked the Emperor.

Combined with the fact that he was speaking in classical Japanese, to which most rank and file troops would have been unfamiliar to, no wonder the soldiers were dead-ass confused about whether to stop or continue fighting|Well, as you can see even in the Wikipedia article, those who refused surrender were just very few fanatical officers. Nobody, be it civilian or soldier, listened seriously to these desperate ramblings as they all experienced uncontested US bombers reducing their homes to ashes.

If people think otherwise, it’s like looking at 20 July plot and thinking significant number in Wehrmacht opposed Hitler. Both have an interesting parallel that the only military force available to the plotters was controlled by falsifying the order, and failed immediately when it was revealed.|Iirc he once was stressed at the rise of nationalist insubordination within the military that he had a talk with the Prime Minister about getting the country's shit together. In shame, the Prime Minister resigned, which is not what Hirohito wanted at all, and so the entire debacle embarrassed him so badly he decided to sort of step away from politics and continue to be a figurehead instead and let his government sort everything out. This only lead to the further chaos at the hands of Japan leading up to WW2. The only other time where he directly intervened was when a hypernationalist group of soldiers tried to overthrow the parliament early on in his name and as things spiraled out of control, only then did he put his foot down and disavow them, which while it did stop much of their rebelling, was ultimately too late for anything meaningful.

I will admit I don't know enough about Hirohito to give a strong opinion on the man, but unlike other Axis leaders, it seemed like he was the one with the least control of his nation.

On August 15, 1943, Allied military forces landed on Kiska Island, which had been occupied by Japanese forces since June 1942. However, the Japanese had secretly abandoned the island two weeks earlier, and so the Allied landings were unopposed. Allied forces suffered over 500 casualties in total during the operation from Japanese landmines and booby traps, friendly fire incidents, and vehicle accidents.

Both U.S. and Canadian forces mistook each other, after a Canadian soldier shot at U.S. lines believing they were Japanese, and a friendly fire incident occurred, which left 28 Americans and 4 Canadians dead, with 50 wounded on either side. Progress was also hampered by mines, timed bombs, accidental ammunition detonations, vehicle accidents and booby traps that caused further casualties. A stray Japanese sea mine caused the USS Abner Read to lose a large chunk of its stern. The blast killed 71 and wounded 47 personnel.

The Protestants were the main beneficiaries of the conflict between Charles and Ferdinand on 
the one hand and on the other hand the Ottomans. ‘‘It wouldn’t have been Turks the Reformation 
would have had most likely the fate of Albigensian’s uprising’’ What prevented Carol in 1526 
to settle by force the religious problem and to dissolve the Diet of Speyer was the pressure 
exerted by the Ottomans on Hungary and Central Europe, and the need to be able to resist using German Protestants. expansion and legitimacy of Lutheranism should be assigned to Ottoman 
imperialism more than any other factor. We have to remember that every principal actor on this 
stage of effervescent century has played his role, be it about the Habsburg Empire, the Ottoman 
power or the Protestant Reformation. Turks favored Protestants insofar as they served their 
interests in Europe, while the latter took full advantage of the Ottoman incursions to consolidate .

Without Ottoman incursions, Protestantism would have the same fate as Cathars.

The decline of Khorasan which was one of the major political and cultural centres of the Muslim world during the Samanid, Ghaznavid and Seljuq periods came not due to the Mongols but due to the local Oghuz Turkmens in the region during the mid-twelfth century. Deborah Tor has written a great article on this topic, see: ""The Eclipse of Khurāsān in the Twelfth Century"" 

The Khwarazmian Empire was a fragile war empire that rapidly expanded just before the Mongol conquests and relied heavily on Qangli-Qipchaq tribes whose chiefs the royal family intermarried with and privileged.

> The integration of regional rulers, however, was not a strong side of the Khwārazmshāhs. They tended to destroy earlier ruling houses. This has been noted in earlier research for the reign of Muḥammad b. Tekesh, but it is true for Tekesh as well. Tekesh destroyed at least two regional powers: Nishapur and the Iraqi Seljuqs. In Nishapur, he installed one of his sons so that the region became a dynastic appanage. He tried to do the same in central and western Iran, with less encouraging results. Muḥammad b. Tekesh in turn destroyed many local and regional dynasties—the Ghūrids, the Qarakhanids, the lords of Nasā and others—to the proﬁt of his close kin, but also of Qıpchaq nobles, mostly kinsmen of the Khwārazmshāh’s mother, the Terken Khatun. This has been noted, even in medieval sources, as one of the main reasons why he was later unable to effectively resist the Mongol onslaught.

> Even the destruction of the Qarakhiṭay Empire (in a number of wars, 1210–1215) has been seen in the same vein: The local or regional or imperial powers standing between the Muslim world and the dreadful Mongols had all been eliminated, and the new power did not have time or was not interested in striking local roots. Moreover, the Qıpchaq groups themselves could not be relied upon, at least not to the point of being loyal to the Khwārazmshāh in the face of such an adversary. It seems to me, however, that the destruction of local and regional ruling houses was not a mistake attributable to the Khwārazmshāh in person, but a necessary consequence of the way he had built up his army: he was obliged to distribute all the spoils he and his army had won in numerous campaigns to the Qıpchaq captains. Not only because his mother wanted him to, but because otherwise, he would not have been able to stay in place. Most of the beneﬁts which the Khwārazmshāh could distribute therefore either fell to his sons or to the Qıpchaq leaders. The internal links of the empire, the imperial lifeline, thus connected the shah and the Qıpchaq leaders, not the imperial lord and regional lords. On the contrary, the Qıpchaq leaders strove to replace the regional lords, and there was not much leeway for maneuver left for the Khwārazmshāh.

1992 saw the realease of Alice in Chains' album *Dirt*, featuring the track *Down in a Hole*. Written and performed by vocalist Jerry Cantrell in honor of his then-girlfriend, *Down in a Hole* is something of a departure from the grunge tunes Alice in Chains is best known for, being a power ballad in which Cantrell discusses his struggles with depression and self doubt. The gentlest, calmest parts of the song, however, describe the relief he found in the intimate moments with his partner.

Two years later, Nine Inch Nails released their seminal album *The Downward Spiral*. On this album was *Closer*, a song that also explored fleeting escapes from depression through intimacy. *Closer*'s tone, however, was a bit more... *direct*. Vocalist Trent Reznor's performance, and the instrumentation backing it, lack many gentle moments or powerful crescendos, but focus more on creeping anxiety and visceral experience.

Now, as for the meme itself, I'm not aware of any actual beef between any of the members of AiC and NIN, nor do I dislike either song. Honestly, I like them both quite a bit. Yet, since the idea first popped into my head months ago, I haven't been able to think of them without thinking of their similarities and differences—and this meme.|One thing I will give Trent Reznor is his unwavering honesty when he wrote that song. Like 90% of the pop and rock music on the radio is love songs, but they're usually full of flowery language and beat around the bush with euphemisms, to sound more ""romantic"" and not offend.

But Trent Reznor was just laying down the facts. I respect him for his openness and honesty more than I will respect any of the 50 Coldplay songs about peering into a lover's eyes or whatever.|Wow, that's a wild evolution of a love song!|Hell yeah I love classic rock|I will never not hear Closer as sung in the Angry White Boy Polka by Weird Al Yankovic.|Ah the 90's.

73,Angels of the Ratlines?,https://i.redd.it/eyep8r0dhrfe1.png,2,2025-01-28 22:03:59,2,"If you are talking about the Catholic Church as a monolithic entity with top-down control, then there was no such effort to help Nazis escape justice. Roughly 12 million refugees were helped by the Catholic Church in the aftermath of WWII, and some people took advantage of this to flee from prosecution. The Vatican was concerned with helping refugees and was less concerned with war criminals. The accusations of ""Vatican ratlines"" are largely unsubstantiated. As Robert Ventresca states in his biography of Pius XII,

>

There were other members of the hierarchy and clergy that did abuse their positions to give aid to war criminals. Perhaps most infamous among them was Bishop Alois Hudal, who helped many infamous Nazi officials flee from Europe. Another example is Father Krunoslav Draganovic. These were Catholic Church officials, but they acted without sanction or approval of the Vatican. Hudal and Pius XII were estranged after the war, and Hudal remained bitter toward the pontiff for the rest of his life. So what ""ratlines"" existed were created without approval or encouragement from the Vatican, and when abuses were found there were attempts made to correct them. This had nothing specific to do with Catholic church, because honestly  where else would those Nazis go ? USA, UK, France, USSR, other Allies ? South America, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Ireland were the only neutral regions during the war. The Nazis probably wanted to get as much distance between themselves and the crime scene as possible, which meant to quit Europe. There were small German minorities in many Latin American countries and they probably would have perceived these countries as more ""Germanic"" than, say, Egypt, which would have pleased them.|Context: After WWII, the Vatican collaborated with Western intelligence agencies to facilitate the escape of high-ranking officials from the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) to countries such as Argentina, Spain, Canada, Australia, and the United States. Among these officials were Ante Pavelic, the leader of the NDH, and Andrija Artuković, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice, who was responsible for concentration camps where over 100,000 people were murdered.

Following the collapse of the NDH, Pavelic, Artuković, and other members of the Ustaše inner circle faced extradition to Yugoslavia and certain death. However, with assistance from the Vatican and Western intelligence networks, they were allowed to escape, as they were deemed useful to the Cold War effort. Pavelic, for instance, received forged papers to disguise himself as a priest, Father Don Pedro Gonner, enabling him to cross into Italy from his hiding place in an Austrian village. He eventually took refuge at the Croatian Institute at Saint Jerome of the Croats in Rome, which had become a sanctuary for Ustaše members and, at one point, harbored 10 members of the NDH cabinet.

Some, like Vjekoslav Luburić, returned to Yugoslavia to lead guerrilla warfare efforts until the late 1940s. These so-called ‘Crusader’ operations, sponsored and armed by British intelligence, aimed to destabilize the Yugoslav state and quickly restore Pavelic to power in Croatia but failed miserably. In the aftermath, the exiles dispersed across the globe, focusing on diaspora activities such as founding newspapers and organizations to propagate their ideology. Such as former judge and intelligence officer Srećko Rover, who settled in Australia, organized multiple armed attempts at anti-communist insurrections in Yugoslavia.

Pavelic eventually used the ratline to escape to Argentina under forged papers with the name Pablo Aranjos, where he served as a security advisor to President Juan Perón's government and attempted to lead the Ustaše movement in exile. In 1957, after an assassination attempt left him severely wounded, he fled to Spain, where he lived under Franco's protection. He died in Madrid in 1959.

Artuković ultimately settled in Los Angeles, California. A public request for his extradition in 1951 was rejected by the United States government in 1959. It wasn’t until the 1980s, that Artuković, now infamously known as ""The Butcher of the Balkans"", was extradited to Yugoslavia. A Zagreb court in May 1986 found him guilty for the murder of 700,000 people when he was interior minister of the Nazi puppet state of Croatia. However, he was deemed too old and frail to execute and died shortly thereafter.",HistoryMemes,1ic5m0b

The freeing nature of wine and alcohol was equated with freeing you from tyranny.

In the [Orphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism) tradition he was the first born son of Zeus and was tortured and dismembered by the titans, but was then reborn and was thus linked with immortality and rebirth.

I mean he did *turn water into wine.*|no no no, the wine one is his son, who's also him, but is also not him|I thought Caelus was the god that the Romans synchrotized the Jewish God with, while the Greeks were the ones who synchrotized God with Bacchus (or rather Dionysius)|Yahweh: ""The next person, or horse, who calls me the 'wine dude' will end up in a bottle of Merlot!""|Mostly because they share the same epithet: Adonai for Yahweh and Adonis for Dionysus, literally means ""the Lord"".|Yahweh was also identified with the Egyptian Set and the Greek Tython|I mean, wine is a vital part of Jewish ritual. To this day one of the most common and frequently recited prayers is the prayer over wine, which is always done on the Jewish Sabbath. It is customary to drink 4 cups of wine on passover, and large amounts in general on a holiday called Purim.

Bacchus though? Let's just say the Jewish god is sort of a hard ass. This isn't long hair sandal wearing Jesus who wants to love and forgive everybody.

He is known for his ambitious but often disastrous policies. Several of MbT’s decisions are considered to have been poorly executed, leading to failure and criticism.

1. ***The Great Migration Fiasco:*** In 1327, MbT thought it’d be fun to move his empire’s capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (in present-day Maharashtra). He believed it would be more centrally located and better suited for the empire. Turns out dragging an entire population across half the sub-continent (>1500 km) wasn’t as brilliant as it sounded. Many people disliked this idea, but as he was an extremely authoritarian ruler, people had to follow. Many died en route to the new capital. Those who had reached/moved-to Daulatabad found it to be an inhospitable place. Everyone hated it as far from the established centers of power and commerce. And, just after 8 years (in 1335), MbT *reversed his decision and moved the capital back to Delhi* in 1335, further undermining his authority.
2. ***Monopoly Money Experiment:*** In 1330, when Daulatabad was still the capital, MbT intended to solve issues of currency shortages. So, he minted and introduced coins made of copper and brass, but he ordered his citizens to be accepted at the same value as gold and silver coins. He assumed people wouldn’t figure out how to counterfeit them. Spoiler: they did. Result: The currency system collapsed, resulting in severe inflation. The economy crashed, and he had to scrap his genius plan. But… by then, the damage had already been done.
3. ***Over-Ambitious Warfare:*** Launched military campaigns (against the kingdoms of Warangal and Madurai) that cost a fortune and achieved... well, not much. Managed to deplete the treasury and lose men for very little gain.
4. ***Peasants’ Delight:*** Where do you think the money for his new capital development and unnecessary military expeditions come from? MbT imposed heavy taxes on the people, especially in the countryside. He hiked taxes so high that farmers couldn't afford to farm anymore. This led to widespread discontent and rebellions across the empire. Who could’ve seen that coming?
5. ***Control Freak Central:*** He tried to centralize power and control. He tried to micromanage the entire empire, but it backfired spectacularly. Turns out, centralizing power doesn’t work when your administrators are corrupt and your plans are over-complicated.

In short, Muhammad bin Tughlaq imposed erratic and often arbitrary decisions without consulting his advisers or considering their practical implications. His over-ambition led to disastrous outcomes, damaging his reputation and weakening his rule. ***His reign is often cited as an example of the pitfalls of reckless ambition in governance.***|That's why they called him Tough Luck I guess.|You could time a watch on it.|Hence the expression in my native language ""Picchi Tuglaq laaga unnav (You are like mad Tuglaq)""",HistoryMemes,1iasleh

> In European history, few love stories are as poignant and politically charged as that of Inês de Castro and King Pedro I of Portugal. ...

> In the heart of 14th-century Portugal, where alliances were often sealed with strategic marriages, the romance between Pedro, the heir to the throne, and Inês, a lady-in-waiting of Galician nobility, blossomed against the backdrop of courtly expectations and dynastic ambitions. What began as a forbidden affair would culminate in a dramatic series of events that saw Inês brutally murdered on royal orders and Pedro, upon ascending the throne, exacting a chilling retribution that would etch their love story into the annals of history.

> One day, while Pedro was away, the King sent three men to the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha in Coimbra, where Inês was detained, and had her killed, decapitating her in front of her small children.

> When Pedro learned that his father had masterminded Inês’s murder, he became enraged and rose in revolt against his father, with Inês’s brothers fighting alongside him. King Afonso defeated his son within a year, but died shortly thereafter. Pedro succeeded to the throne in 1357. Immediately, he sought out Inês's killers, who had gone into hiding in Castile, and managed to capture two of them. Legend has it that he executed them publicly by ripping their hearts out with his own hands.

> Pedro claimed that he had secretly married Inês some years earlier, making her the rightful queen. According to legend, the king ordered her body to be exhumed, dressed, crowned, and placed on the throne for her coronation. He commanded the courtiers to swear allegiance to her, something they had neglected to do during her lifetime, by kissing the hem of her gown. After the ceremony, she was buried in the royal monastery in Alcobaça.|""DID I FUCKING STUTTER?!""|And that's also the origin of a Portuguese idiom, ""Inês é morta"" (Inês is dead), which means something to the effect of ""it doesn't matter anymore, it's already happened"".|But sire she's a corpse

The study of history and the science in history is about getting as close as possible to those events. And yes, every person and source is biased, as it is for every science. That is why we use peer reviews, where people of differing opinions critique your work.|Context  
  
The earliest stage of historiography (referring to Greco-Roman classic period, at least) doesn't use scientific method. Herodotus, for example, famously incorporates oracles, hearsay and inaccurate facts into his work. The same can be said as St. Augustine, who cherrypicked his references to fit his Christian narrative, and used Bible fully as a historical source. Historical works, to them, are to serve as a lesson to the readers, particularly noticeable in St. Augustine's ""the City of Gods"". Thucydides and his followers are an exception to this, of course. 



""History is science"" refers to a famous quote by J.B. Bury (1861-1927), an Irish historian who was influenced by Leopold von Ranke, perhaps one of the most influential historian of the 19th century AD. Leopold von Ranke was the person who introduced source criticism and the emphasis on primary sources. To him and his followers, history has to be as objective as possible, and it is historian's duty to present history as how it was actually happened or ""\*wie es eigentlich gewesen\*"". They believed that history can be as scientific as actual science subjects. 



Criticism of the objectivists came from people like Karl Marx, E.H. Carr and Benedetto Croce (1866-1952). Croce is the one I'm the most familiar among them three so I will speak about him. He believed that history cannot be objective, because it is, at the end of the day, interpretations historians. There is no way a historian can fully avoid bias, even Leopold von Ranke himself couldn't. And even if someone can be perfectly objective, the sources they use certainly aren't. We are learning about history as how it is narrated, not as how it happened. History therefore cannot be science. 



I'm just speaking from the top of my head, using what I've learned in the lecture. Please correct me if there is any error!|English problems ....

In German you have the word ""Wissenschaft"" which is more broad than ""Science"" (which is Naturwissenschaft in German, namely the natural sciences) to resolve that issue. ""Wissenschaft"" entails all fields which have a rigorous method.

More specifically history is a so called ""Geisteswissenschaft"" which also contains philosophy, art, pedagogic and strictly speaking mathematics and other structural sciences..|I mean science is reproducible, which history by its nature cannot be. |In the words of my history professor, history is about having the bare outline of an event and having to write a compelling story around it.|history is art because its a fan fic most of the times|Yes the art of war|Why not both?|History is stupid and amazing actions put to paper.

Create rivalry between Peter and Paul.|Peter and Paul are two of the most important figures in Christianity, but they didn’t always see eye-to-eye. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus tells Peter, “On this rock I will build my church,” which has traditionally been understood as Jesus designating Peter as the foundational leader of the early Church. But Paul, who wasn’t one of the original apostles, played a huge role in spreading Christianity to Gentiles (non-Jews), and his writings make it clear he had some strong opinions about how the Church should operate.


The tension between the two is most apparent in the early debates about whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish law, like circumcision. Paul was adamant that they didn’t, while Peter initially seemed to favor a more Jewish-centric approach. This led to some public disagreements, like in Galatians 2, where Paul rebukes Peter for pulling away from eating with Gentiles when other Jewish Christians were around.|I find it particularly interesting that that rivalry keeps existing in the Catholic and Lutheran churches. Catholics basically try to reincarnate Peter every few years, while Lutherans strongly base their doctrine on Paul’s letters.|I resent that comparison when Paul is being passionate and reasoned in his disagreements. Paul’s letters defending his claims are thoughtful and use period-accurate debating etiquette to support his arguments.

On the other hand, you have the people defending circumcision. They follow the same trend circumcision defenders have clung to for millennia; they just act *insufferably condescending* even when backed into a corner and harangue the opponent with calls of “u mad?”/“you’re butthurt”. It’s like arguing with a kindergartener.|One of the ways Paul states his claim to authority is by saying it was confirmed by the 'pillars' of the Church who were Peter, James and John. In Galatians, he claims that what he is doing among the Gentiles is what Peter is doing among the Jews.

Peter's authority is therefore very important for Paul, he just doesn't like Peter's backsliding which makes even less sense when you consider Peter's vision when meeting with Cornelius. 

For Protestants, this whole episode is great as James takes on the role of Chair for the Council. The Council deliberates and overrules Peter who was originally rebuked by Paul. This is how Church government should work, not Peter placed on a throne with a crown laying down the law, Peter got things wrong and he followed Christ in person. 

Some guy in Rome 2000 years later has even less claim to infallibility.|Everyone knows that the true first Karen was Nanni.

Mughal empire was weakening after Aurangzeb's death. After brief conflict, Marathas were divided into two factions, one under Shahu Maharaj at Satara and another under Sambhaji II in Kolhapur. Bajirao I (then just 20 years old) was made Peshwa (Prime Minister) by Shahu around 1720 and under his command Maratha forces were expanding into Karnatak region. Mughal governor of Deccan region, Nizam-ul-Mulk saw it as rising threat and decided to crush it. Sambhaji II of Kolhapur too joined him in this enterprise. Seeing the looming threat, Shahu Maharaj recalled Bajirao from Karnatak and prepared for war. 

There was one particular difference between Nizam's force and Maratha force. Nizam's force had elephants, camels, heavy artillery, supply trains and number of non-combatants, while Maratha force under Bajirao was almost exclusively cavalry. No supply trains, no heavy artillery and no non-combatants. 

First, to pull Nizam away from Western Maharashtra, Bajirao advanced to Burhanpur, a major city in Mughal empire. Hearing about it, Nizam decided to pursue Peshwa. But by the time he reached Burhanpur with his force, Bajirao had already plundered the city and reached Gujarat region via Khandesh, plundering every Mughal trade center on his way. Annoyed by this, Nizam decided to attack Pune (from where Shahu Maharaj was handling the affairs). Marathas made little to no resistance to Nizam's advance. But when Nizam reached Baramati, he received news that Bajirao is already in (then) Aurangabad, another major Mughal city and military center in the region. 

Frustrated by this, Nizam kept his heavy artillery at Ahmednagar to reach Aurangabad as soon as possible, crossed Godāvari river near Puntamba and camped on the other side of the river near Palkhed. 

What he was completely unaware of was Bajirao had already reached the area and even closed Nizam's way back to crossing of Godāvari river behind him. Next day when Nizam's men went to get some water, they found that even another small water reservior nearby was surrounded. Nizam attempted to breakthrough, but failed everytime. By this time, Sambhaji II, too had withdrawn the support. Finally, exhausted, starved and thirsty Nizam raised the white flag. A treaty was signed at Mungi-Shevgav and finally Nizam's army had food and water. Nizam accepted every term Marathas put forward. He abandoned his territorial claims and actually agreed Marathas right to collect taxes in some of his territories. Also agreed to never join hands with Kolhapur. 

Battle of Palkhed remains one of the greatest examples of maneuver warfare and was later termed as 'masterpiece of strategic mobility' by FM Bernard Montgomery in his book 'A Concise History of Warfare'.",HistoryMemes,1ibakwb

Theodore Roosevelt, though not outright hostile to them, still viewed the majority of Irish-Americans with much disdain. “They are a stupid, sodden vicious lot, most of them being equally deficient in brains and virtue.” As he had just been elected to the New York Assembly, he got to see these folks more closely. “The average Catholic Irishman of the first generation as represented in this assembly, is a low, venal, corrupt and unintelligent brute.”

Law school was decidedly not for him, so he took a trip up to Morton Hall, where the professionals & businessman of the political sort gathered. Here he fell under the wing of one Joseph Murray, an Irishman who jumped from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. Theodore, detesting Tammany Hall and the Democrats as the “party of disunion & rebellion,” fell in with the Republicans. 

Roosevelt, with a well-known name and a member of Columbia, seemed like a good pick as Murray’s candidate for the Twenty-First District. After securing the spot as the Republican nominee, Roosevelt’s family was divided. His Uncle James expressed stern disapproval, as did many of his cousins. Regardless, Murray decided it was time for Roosevelt to campaign for the spot, and organized a meeting between the candidate and the influential Saloon Row on Sixth Avenue. At the very first stop on the tour, the owner of the saloon, one “Fisher”, stated that he expected the candidate to treat the liquor business fairly, mentioning that the liquor licenses were too expensive at the moment. Upon hearing the price of $200, Roosevelt, counterproductively, declared that such a price was far too low, and that it should in fact be $1,000.

In 1810, he was elected to be heir presumptive of Sweden. Before taking the throne, he had publicly declared and even visited many of his superiors and equals to make clear that once he took the Swedish throne, he would have to prioritize Swedish interests even above France’s. Most of those he visited including Napoleon agreed, and off he went. 

In the years that followed relations cooled dramatically. Napoleon without provocation seized Swedish Pomerania, Sweden’s richest province and last mainland Europe holding. Outraged, Bernadotte refused to aid in the invasion of Russia, preventing a two front war and freeing up 20,000 troops to face Napoleon, contributing to Napoleon's defeat. 

In 1813, seeing Napoleon’s catastrophic losses in Russia and with Britain's offer of financial aid and the gain of Norway, Sweden declared war on France. This act of realpolitik provoked outrage in France. Newspapers decried him a traitor, former subordinates and his coworkers denounced him. In fact, according to many accounts Ney personally requested Napoleon put him in charge of the army tasked with capturing Berlin, as Bernadotte’s army was nearby and he hoped to fight the turncloak in person. 

This is despite, as mentioned earlier, Bernadotte now being the Swedish monarch, not French.|Well to be fair to the French, Napoleon did say this about Bernadotte: ""I cannot say that he (Bernadotte) betrayed me. In a manner he became a Swede, and never promised that which he did not intend to perform. I can accuse him of ingratitude, but not of treachery.""|An honourable mention of his spouse Désirée or Drottning Desideria as she is known here, she at first hated the cold climate and missed the grandeur of Paris instead of stifling court procedures in a foreign country in fact court life was something she never took a liking to. She even stayed for a number years in Paris even though her spouse had been crowned King by that time.

There's a couple of funny anecdotes regarding her eccentric behaviour, like that she was an night owl and had a habit of visiting friends and acquaintances very late in the evening or even in the middle night which caused a bit of a ruckus and also liked to ride her carriage before bed time in the mornings and would always say god morgon to the workers of the court as they prepared for the work day. Other times she used to invite the children of Stockholm to ride with her in the carriage around the court yard and while treating them to candy she would say ""kring kring"" which means ""around around"" but in this it also means faster.

The king was known to have a bit of a temper and she checked it at multiple times in that very direct French way that only a French spouse can. Her lady in waiting wrote after her death that it her life didn't have any big happening from her coronation to her death but she is still remembered quite fondly here in Sweden mostly from when she as a dowager Queen was known for her thoughtful and generous behaviour towards the less fortunate in Sweden and Norway even though most of it was done very discrete.|“Nobody has had a career like mine.”

Dude had every right to say that in his deathbed. :) Born a commoner, rose through the ranks, married the ex-fiancée of Napoleon Bonaparte, became a Marshal of France, held several princely titles, and crowned king of Sweden–mostly through a fluke, but it worked out in the end. Unlike Napoleon, his descendants still sit in the throne of Sweden today. :)

Shame we don’t have movies about this guy. We do have a few (only two, actually) about his wife Désirée Clary, but [the one I’ve watched that was based after Annemarie Selinko’s novel](https://youtu.be/svfqpfnQd7Q?si=HWLSqCUz3JUWbb70) is very much a fictionalized version of history, and the source material has quite a few discrepancies, too. Still, it’s an interesting take, and one of the few starting points available for studying the Bernadottes. Marlon Brando’s casting in that film is superb, and I think he would have made a fine Napoleon Bonaparte in a more ambitious film.

* * *

 Napoleon (speaking to Désirée):

”Strange our paths–yours and mine’s and Bernadotte’s: you will go to Sweden and become a queen.

The two most outstanding men of our time have fallen in love with you–and you’re no real beauty but you do have a way with you.”

Even when he doesn’t believe something, he reports what he was told—most notably demonstrated by the Phoenicians who he didn’t think had circumnavigated Africa (they did). The gross overestimate for the size of Xerxes’s army is rooted in an effort to make quantifiable statements. Herodotus makes some incredibly impressive speculations about all sorts of things. He makes suggestions about the geography of Egypt which are ultimately incorrect, but show he was completely capable of comprehending geologic timescales. He talks about links between the Phoenicians and what would later be the Carthaginians, and also guesses that the Greek alphabet is descended from the Phoenician alphabet, which we now know is true. The guy also traveled on foot or boat through literally the entire ancient world which was known to Greeks. He could have done better, but he happened to be the first person literally ever to do what he did in any sort of rigorous fashion. He started his Histories as an attempt to basically write a rick steves travel guide to the ancient Mediterranean, and eventually came to the realization that he could tell narrative history as something separate from geography and try to apply analytic thinking to learn from it.

EDIT: frankly, the really dubious historians are the later ones in the Roman Empire who were writing about Alexander hundreds of years after his conquests and trying to shoehorn in a Roman worldview.

The Ming history text in question was written from the perspective of the previous dynasty and failed to edit out a number of offenses against the current Qing regime. Thousands were implicated while the entire Zhuang entire family and other people closely associated were all put to death.

Zhuang Tinglong was a prosperous merchant who sought to improve his social standing by writing a history book. Not familiar with the subject, he bought an unpublished work to put his own name on it and hired a number of local scholars to edit it. He died shortly after the publication. Four scholars who were among the ones credited as editors, including one Zha Jizuo, first reported it to the regional academician. According to them, they were paid to put their name on the text to enhance its reputation but had not actually read it until the publication. Nothing came of their report. Later, a man named Wu Shirong managed to get the government to open an investigation.

After the fall of Qing, the case was often mentioned in the context of the Manchu government's heavy-handed treatment against ethnic Han people. Wu's denouncement was considered a betrayal of the Han race as a whole. For whatever reason, among popular retellings, Wu emerged as the sole villain of the story. Since his own time, Zha was a minor folk celebrity. His friendship with a Qing general named Wu Liuqi was celebrated in folk stories. Indeed, according to them, it was Wu who interceded to save Zha and Zha's denouncement was entirely whitewashed. Some later people were quite shocked to learn that Zha was actually among the first informants.

The case serves as the backdrop in the famous novel The Deer and the Cauldron. The author Jin Yong, real name Zha Liangyong, belonged to the same Zha family and might have been Jizuo's direct descendant. The novel repeats the folk account and depicts Wu as the sole informant. And although the novel was fictional, the author had remarked that he didn't like fictionalizing things specifically to make historical figures look better.|It's a shame this is sub is like, half ww2 memes, then around 49% memes about western history, with only 1% memes outside of those western countries.",HistoryMemes,1iacd3h

Early on in WWII the United Kingdom recognized the need for sub machine guns in their army. While they already had the Lanchester sub machine gun in production and were buying Thompsons from the Americans, the Tompson was expensive and the Lanchester took a while to manufacture. To help bolster the number of small arms the UK had, in 1940 they tested and quickly adopted the STEN gun as it was a very simple and effective weapon that was very cheap and quick to produce. Now that the UK had their new gun they needed someone to make it and since the Singer factory in Scotland had surplus labor and tooling they decided that they should be the ones to manufacture pretty much all of the MK1 STEN guns. The problem was the Singer corporation was American and at this time America was not involved in WWII and so Singer didn't want to be either. So the UK responded by nationalizing the factory and ""awarding"" the Singer factory a contract to manufacture 300,000 copies of the MK1 STEN gun.

129,That One Time Abu Nuwas went into Berserk Mode in his Poetry (Context in Comment),https://i.redd.it/4a01rvw7n7fe1.jpeg,189,2025-01-26 03:16:09,6,"Abu Nuwas once met with Muhammad ibn Riyah in the gathering of some members of the Barmakid family. A dispute and argument broke out between them, so Muhammad ibn Riyah said about him:

>Hassan (Abu Nuwas) complained to us of a pain
In his rear, a burning wound he couldn’t sustain.
So we soothed his sore with salve and balm,
Then turned to a plump maiden, soft and calm.

>A rod always at her back, a rod that never tires,
Spilling from the loins a milk that never expires.
We feasted on her and rose with delight,
Like rams preparing for a butting fight.

>O son of a baseborn line, stand before me!
No insult from a bastard can bring me worry.
By the grace of Al-Fadl bin Yahya (The Barmakid), so kind,
There’s none to match him, none you’ll ever find.

>Your mother bore you in disgraceful sin,
Born from the filthy acts she wallowed in.
A woman who spreads herself for the revelers’ lust,
So don’t raise your voice at me, keep your words just.

#Abu Nuwas Replied :

>Our heart consoled itself over thoughts of wine,
But how can it console a heart that’s left behind,
Spending the night watching every star,
Following one until it fades with dawn’s light afar?

>Muhammad bin Riyaḥ sought to insult me,
But the disgrace of his attempt fell back on him swiftly.
Do you forget your mother’s shameful cry,
As she spun helplessly beneath my thigh?

>She sang to me as she mounted on high,
And sat astride, unashamed, with a wanton sigh.
Aren’t we the best to ever ride the beasts?
The most generous when it comes to the feasts of lustful feats?

>I told her, “Cease your pretensions, this is not the time,
For praising or mocking in measured rhyme.”
“The moment calls for acts, not speech,” I said,
“For thrusting spears into the deepest stead.”

>She replied, “Here, take my leg and raise it high,
And plunge your lance deep, don’t be shy.”
When the deed was done, she began to sing,
Calling out to her kin with a joyous ring.

Context : In the year 145 AH, Abu Nuwas was born. His father was a soldier in the army of Caliph Marwan ibn Muhammad, the last Umayyad caliph in Damascus. After the caliph’s army was defeated, Abu Nuwas’s father moved to Basra, and at that time, Abu Nuwas was two years old. His father passed away when he was still young, so his mother took care of him. When he grew older, he worked as a perfumer.

Abu Nuwas memorized the Quran and studied jurisprudence and Quranic interpretation. It is said, “A companion pulls you in their direction,” and so, when Abu Nuwas met the famous Kufan poet Walibah ibn al-Habbab, he accompanied him to Kufa. This poet was known for his debauchery, licentiousness, and drinking wine, and Abu Nuwas learned poetry and indulgence from him as well.

When Abu Nuwas returned to Basra, he met the poet Khalaf al-Ahmar, who taught him poetry in a way that enabled him to master language and literature. Khalaf would give him thirty ancient poems to memorize, then ask him to forget them and give him new ones, so Abu Nuwas’s style would not be influenced by older poetry.

Abu Nuwas’s indulgence and debauchery increased, and he became infamous for immorality and drinking wine, earning him the title “Poet of Wine.” He even took his provocative poetry to the point of inciting irreverence toward mosques.

Abu Nuwas's mother, Julban, was a wealthy woman in Basra renowned for her compassion and her extraordinary commitment to caring for abandoned and illegitimate children. This practice made her widely known in the community. In a society where women who bore illegitimate children often resorted to abandoning them, hoping the evidence of their indiscretion would perish, Julban became a symbol of mercy and humanity, she was known be her title ""Al-Muḥsinah"" (The Charitable Woman).

She would spend long hours in the dark desert nights, listening for the cries of helpless infants. Driven by a deep sense of duty and compassion, she would search tirelessly, rescuing these abandoned children. Julban would take them into her home, offering them shelter and raising them as if they were her own. Her dedication and nurturing spirit left a lasting impact on the lives she saved, creating a legacy of kindness and generosity in the community.

It was opened as part of Operation Reinhard, the plan to exterminate European Jews. Over 250,000 men, women and children were killed here in gas chambers by the time it closed.

However, one thing the Nazis did not count on was Alexander Pechersky. He was a young Soviet soldier who had been captured in battle and sent to Sobibor to serve as slave labor in order to keep the camp in operation. Pechersky very quickly made a name for himself due to having no fear and standing up to the S.S. One account relates how he was chopping wood with a group of prisoners when an S.S. officer began savagely beating an old prisoner for not working hard enough:

>Pechersky stopped chopping and watched the whipping while resting on his axe. Kapo Porzyczki translated when [S.S. officer] Frenzel asked Pechersky if he didn't like what he saw. Pechersky didn't bow down, shake or cower in fear but answered, Yes Oberscharführer. Frenzel told Pechersky that he had 5 minutes to split a large tree stump in two. If Pechersky beat the time he would receive a pack of cigarettes, if he lost, he would be whipped 25 times. Frenzel looked at his watch, and said: Begin.

>Pechersky split the stump in four and a half minutes and Frenzel held out a pack of cigarettes and announced that he always does as he promises. Pechersky replied that he doesn't smoke, turned around and got back to chopping down new tree stumps. Frenzel came back twenty minutes later with fresh bread and butter and offered it to Pechersky. Pechersky replied that the rations at the concentration camp were more than adequate and that he wasn't hungry. Frenzel turned around and left, leaving Kapo Porzyczki in charge. That evening, this episode of defiance spread throughout Sobibor. This episode influenced the leadership of the Polish Jews to approach Pechersky about ideas for an escape plan.

Pechersky would go on to murder 12 S.S. officers before escaping the camp with a group of other prisoners. He engaged in guerilla operations against the Nazis for the remainder of the war and died in relative obscurity in 1990. Because of Pechersky's actions, almost 50 Jews survived; the last survivor died in 2019.|Hugo Stiegliz?|>Ukrainian Chad exacts revenge on 12 SS guards

- Arthur “Bomber” Harris, criticizing the official British position that the RAF bombing campaign was meant to target industry and military targets and that civilian casualties were an unintended side effect. He wanted them to be honest that the area bombing, instead of precision bombing, was intended as a terror campaign to force Germany’s capitulation (he believed the bombing campaign would force Germany to end the war in months).

>The train brought in 3500 of the 437,000 Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz between 15 May and 8 July 1944. Almost all of them were murdered|Uncasual reminder that fascist governments are ,with some exceptions, actually pretty trash at governing. It ends up that a huge structure based on party allegiance stifles necessary dissent and encourages lying about success.|By 1944, axis was a death cult. Using trains for the army wouldn't have made much difference.|It's called the Hitler Paradox:

*If not for Hitler and the Nazis, Germany might've won the war; but if not for Hitler and the Nazis, there wouldn't have been that war.*

It's actually really impressive how fascism managed to nerf Germans' efficiency buff. Nazis truly were our greatest allies in defeating the Nazis.|The idea that the Holocaust diverted resources from the war effort is more myth than reality, and historians in recent years have given credible criticisms to this myth. I'm just gonna put a quote here by Dan Stone, an English historian who has written extensively about the Holocaust, and he makes it very clear that the Holocaust didn't overwhelm railways or diverted necessary resources from the war effort in any meaningful degree.

>\[W\]e should not be deceived by this apocalyptic language, the Wagnerian grandiosity of the Nazis' vision, or even the huge numbers killed, into thinking that the genocide of the Jews took up a significant amount of German manpower or resources; in fact, it had no impact on the Germans ability to wage war. Further, not only did Auschwitz's German garrison at its height contain no more men than a single Wehrmacht regiment, but the camp itself was built on bartered material and pre-existing structures. In other words, the amount of the Third Reich's resources that was used to carry out the Holocaust was miniscule. Furthermore, these resources were used for the most part before they became scare; as historian Peter Haye notes, 'three-quarters of the Jews murdered in the Holocaust died before the German surrender at Stalingrad'. Hayes calculates, in a remarkable statistical analysis, that the number of Jews transported to death camps on deportation trains (some 2.5 million in 1942-43) is less than 0.5 percent of the more than 6.6 billion passengers carried by the Reichsbahn in that period; if one takes 1944 into account, the percentage of deported Jews becomes 0.3 per cent. The number of trains involved in taking Jews to their deaths from outside the General Government is reckoned at 821, meaning that the total number of wagons used in three years, at 24,317, is 16.3 per cent of the total number of wagons used *every day* by the Reichsbahn in 1942-4 (149,200). The Holocaust had almost no bearing on German resources, least of all on its railways

p. 107-108, *The Holocaust: An Unfinished History*

The Germans were willing to kill enormous number of Jews on the cheap, all the while extracting the most profit possible, be it from forced labour or from plundering Jewish wealth.|I mean, weren't they low on resources to transport in the first place?

2: what do you think how many trains does it take to transport humans in cattle wagons filled to the brim? Let me tell you, not a hell lot. 
3: ya'll seem to think that nazi logistics was some super efficient machine. Well it wasn't. Trains headed for death camps made very little to no difference whatsoever.

At the end of the day the Nazis wanted to conquer all of Europe and implement a ethnic hierarchy. So, despite being at war with Britain they didn't ""hate"" the British as they weren't an enemy just misguided brothers.

The one true enemy that they couldn't allow was the communist, the homosexual, and the worst of them all the Jews. 

So, in their minds they were thinking that if they lost the war then they could still build themselves back up and one day return, however if they didn't wipe out their ""true enemies"" then they would do the same.

>In 1977 and 1979, several petitions were signed by a number of prominent French intellectuals, doctors, and psychologists calling for reforms to or the abolition of the French age-of-consent law. A January 1977 petition published in Le Monde criticized the Affaire de Versailles [fr]—the detention of three men arrested for sex offences against children aged 12–13. A May 1977 petition addressed at the French Parliament called for the equalization of homosexual and heterosexual ages of consent. A 1979 petition published in Libération defended a man arrested for sexual relations with girls aged 6–12.

>Michel Foucault argued that it is intolerable to assume that a minor is incapable of giving meaningful consent to sexual relations.[ Foucault also believed consent, as a concept, was a ""contractual notion"", and that it was not a sufficient measure of whether harm was being conducted.

This does not necessarily mean they were all pedophiles, as the border between what was morally right or wrong regarding sexual acts was very fuzzy at the time and homosexuality was at its peak of discussion, most of them simply didn't know where to draw the line and saw limiting sexual acts in children as repressive for the discoveries of their sexual identities. Take it with a grain of salt, but the ones that signed were as follows:

After the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government saw the necessity to modernize/westernize their army, but due to the objections from the more powerful conservative factions they had to start with small experimental army groups. This job was given to Yuan because he was one of the more higher ranked officers who were vocal about modernization, and had successfully defeated the Japanese army in several small skirmishes in Korea.

He was later appointed to the position of governor of Shangdong to deal with an international incident where some Boxer cultists murdered a German priest. Shangdong was basically where the Boxer movement started, and before this particular murder there were already several violent incidents that resulted in a lot of deaths involving both German civilians and Chinese Christians, and the German embassy demanded a Qing response, specifically one with a modernized army (they actually really liked Yuan).

So Yuan was sent in with his new model army to replace the previous governor. When he was there he saw a Boxer recruitment drive where one of their captains was demonstrating his bulletproofing faith power, by having one of his soldiers shooting blanks at him and he would swing his hands around in the air to ""catch"" the musket balls. Yuan proceeded to pull out his revolver and shot the guy right in the chest and went ""Oh my goodness! Was your prayer not working today or are you all not real Boxers?""

He then ordered his men to just shoot any ""Boxer"" on sight because, you know, they said they were bulletproof, so if they died they either lied about their faith power or they were imposters, and in either case they would've been lying to the Emperor and should be executed.|""Hahaha!

Shōichi Yokoi was an apprentice tailor when he was conscripted in 1941. Initially, Yokoi served with the 29th Infantry Division in Manchukuo. In 1943, he was transferred to the 38th Regiment in the Mariana Islands and arrived on Guam in February 1943. When American forces captured the island in the 1944 Battle of Guam, Yokoi went into hiding with nine other Japanese soldiers. Seven of the original ten eventually moved away and only three remained in the region.

These men separated, but visited each other periodically until about 1964, when the other two died in a flood. For the last eight years before his discovery, Yokoi lived alone. He survived by hunting, primarily at night. He also used native plants to make clothes, bedding, and storage implements, which he carefully hid in his cave.

On the evening of 24 January 1972, Yokoi was discovered by two local men checking shrimp traps along a small river on Talofofo. They had assumed Yokoi was a villager from Talofofo, but he thought his life was in danger and attacked them.They managed to subdue him and carried him out of the jungle.

Yokoi later said that he expected the local men to kill him at first but was surprised when instead they allowed him to eat hot soup at their home before turning him over to the authorities. He was in relatively good health, but slightly anemic due to a lack of salt in his diet, according to doctors at Guam Memorial Hospital. His diet included wild nuts, mangos, papaya, shrimp, snails, frogs, and rats.

""It is with much embarrassment that I return,"" he said upon his return to Japan in March 1972. The remark quickly became a popular saying in Japan. He had known since 1952 that World War II had ended but feared coming out of hiding, explaining: ""We Japanese soldiers were told to prefer death to the disgrace of getting captured alive.""

The application was rejected on the grounds that Morocco was not considered to be a “European country” and hence could not join. This geographic membership criterion has been part of the EU’s and its predecessors’ treaties since the Treaty of Rome (Article 237 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community) and was later also included among the Copenhagen criteria.

Then comes also that Morrocco is culturally very different from Europe and has human rights concerns. It was also still an absolute and brutally opressive monarchy at the time.

And the only way they know to counter one is just throw bombs at it.|Not harsh enough. Even 40-50 years old, the M1 Abrams can still protect its crew with good success.

No comparable tanks? Just how many countries adopted the Sherman? The Patton tanks? How many still use them to *this day* (I’ll give you a hint, it’s more than 2 nations).

Also…your arguments make zero sense. When an enemy creates means to counter your armor and make your vehicle obsolete, you upgrade it to counteract those issues or manufacture a better vehicle. If your upgrade packages “can’t fix everything” and your tank blows up and kills the entire crew as soon as anything looks at it, your tank is dogshit.|For the umpteenth time. No the west had comparable tanks. The T-55 and T-62 were not nearly as good as everyone thinks they had some advantages but as shown in multiple conflicts such as the Yom Kippur War, Lebanon war, Operation Urgent Fury and Iraq/Iran the M60 could go toe to toe with Soviet armor and that is why they were still used and upgraded all the way till the 90s. 

The T-34 which was a barely functional project till the last run was on par with the Shermans and their variants. The T-44s and IS-2s were on par with the M26 Pershing and the later ran M46-48 Patton tanks which were the competitor to the T-54s and 55s.

The French would also have the AMX-30 series to compete with the 54s, 55s and 62s. The Germans had the Leopard series. The Brits had the Centurion. Cheiftain and Challenger 1.

Look I can go on but no if you look at a lot of the ""Losses"" in the cold war by the west such as the Vietnam war you would notice it really wasn't a tank heavy war on either side because of the whole fact that you're in a jungle and you're more likely to deal with something like the M50 Ontos a infantry support vehicle. Tank battles in the cold war would always prove that while each side had it's benefits no side really completely dominated each other in the tank game. For the air game yeah the U.S just slaughtered the soviets once the F-14 rolled around and has really held onto the air dominance title ever since which makes sense with the US's main battle doctrine involving not air superiority but air dominance. But that's a separate topic.|I'd be less harsh on the Soviet tanks of the 50s and 60s if they weren't still using them today.|Last time russia designed a tank was something like 60 years ago, T-64 (designed in Ukraine) or T-72 (the cheaper T-64 designed in russia out of spite).

> Adeline Louise Maria Horsey De Horsey was born on Christmas Eve in 1824, to a wealthy family in Berkeley Square, London, the oldest of three children and the only daughter. ...

> ... she saw a great deal of her father’s friend, the Earl of Cardigan whom she had known since a child. Cardigan was unhappily married to a divorcee, and had separated, consoling himself with amenable ladies. But he was enchanted by his friend’s beautiful and vivacious daughter. He invited Adeline and her father to a house-party at Deene Park and was smitten as soon as he saw her there. Despite being twenty-seven years her senior and married, Cardigan also dazzled Adeline. He was a Royal favourite, wealthy, and a war hero, having heroically led the infamous ‘Charge of the Light Brigade’ during the Crimean War. Adeline found him fascinating and fell deeply in love with him too.

> It was highly improper, and Queen Victoria never forgave Adeline for it, but Cardigan began courting her, taking her for outings whilst unchaperoned. Lady Cardigan was terminally ill, and this bad behaviour caused much gossip upsetting Adeline’s father and brothers. They pleaded with her to stop, but she refused. She became Cardigan’s mistress, and Adeline began to be shunned by her Society friends, but it did not affect her happiness.

> Within the year Lady Cardigan died, and they were free to marry. ... In December 1858, Adeline, now Countess of Cardigan returned to Deene Park as its mistress, to be greeted by six hundred tenants on horseback accompanying the couple from the railway station to the House. This began the happiest ten years of Adeline’s life.

> The new Countess threw herself into country estate life with her husband. She especially enjoyed riding and hunting with the Quorn, Belvoir, Cottesmore and Pytchley, becoming a popular figure in Northamptonshire Society, less concerned with morals than London Society. Cardigan indulged his lively young wife, even building her a ballroom at Deene so she could party in style and kept her mounted on the most elegant horses to show off her graceful horsemanship. Sadly, this blissful time ended abruptly in 1868 when Lord Cardigan died after a fall from a horse. His body lay in state in the ballroom and was viewed by six thousand mourners. An elaborate funeral followed for the war hero with internment in Deene Church.

> Lord Cardigan was childless and left everything to his beloved Adeline for her lifetime. Although the estates were heavily mortgaged, she was proud of the improvements she made to the house and estate. Adeline loved Deene inside and out, even its ghosts. She wrote with pride describing the new stables and a riding school she built, and the restoration of Deene Church and the construction of the Brudenell family Chapel to house the grand tomb of her husband. She continued to live mostly at Deene for the rest of her life.

> Widowed and wealthy in her mid-forties, the Dowager Countess now enjoyed the status of a courtesan. Queen Victoria’s society had not forgiven her for the scandal of her marriage to the Crimean war hero, but the Prince of Wales’s Set enjoyed her company. ...

> Holidaying in Paris, Adeline met and married Don Antonio de Lancastre, a Portuguese noble. She enjoyed travelling with him in Lisbon and Paris before returning to Deene Park, apparently needing to attend to estate business. Don Antonio found the countryside uncomfortable, and they spent much of their marriage apart.

> Adeline further incurred Queen Victoria’s displeasure by styling herself Countess of Cardigan and Lancastre using both her English and Portuguese titles. The Queen was offended because she herself travelled Europe incognito as the Countess of Lancaster.

> Adeline was widowed again in 1898, and now enjoyed her eccentricities to the full. Popular locally and generous with her tenants, she became something of a local tourist attraction, riding and cycling through the area wearing Lord Cardigan’s bright red military trousers. She enjoyed smoking in public, considered most unladylike, as were the steeplechases she organised through the estate graveyard. She continued entertaining at Deene, and famously scandalised her guests by arranging herself elegantly in her coffin, which she kept in the ballroom and asking to be admired. She frittered away the family fortune she had been left, and eventually had to sell off some of her possessions including the stables she had built.

> In her last years she dictated her book ‘My Recollections’ a best-selling volume full of scandalous gossip, remaining unrepentant to the last. Adeline died at her beloved Deene Park in 1915 and was interred in the church next to the love of her life, Lord Cardigan.

In 1990, this flag was made official by an act of Congress “as a symbol of our Nation’s concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, thus ending the uncertainty for their families and the Nation.” This is despite all US POWs having been returned by the end of 1973.

He is also considered to be the father of the power chord due to his use of it on this song. He accomplished this by stabbing his amplifier’s speaker cone with a pencil.

The record producer originally hated it but relented after his stepdaughter liked it. When it finally dropped in 1958, it became the first and only instrumental song banned from playing on the radio in the U.S. The radio stations at the time argued the song glorified juvenile delinquency as the word rumble was slang for a street fight. The harsh playing of the guitar, in their eyes, seemed to audibly resemble a street fight.

Despite this ban from the airwaves, it still made Top 20 (16th) on the Pop Chart and Top 20 (11th) in the R&B Chart in 1958. 

Countless musicians such as Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Iggy Pop, and Pete Townshend of the Who have cited this song as an inspiration to pursue music.

""Rumble"" would be put into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2008, followed ten years later by being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Link Wray himself would finally be inducted, on the third time to be nominated, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

According to Rolling Stone, he is ranked 98th out of 250 of the greatest guitarists of all time..

While South Korea was also authoritarian, its Leadership wasn't incompetent nor especially corrupt for the standards of the region.

South Vietnams opponent was also much more competent; Kim was a brutal and egotistical warlord who cared little for his people, while Ho Chi Min was a strategic and genuinely patriotic man who wanted a united and free Vietnam.|Ngo Dinh Diem, the staunchly Catholic president of South Vietnam, rose to power in the 1950s with strong backing from the United States. A devout nationalist, Diem envisioned a South Vietnam unified under his rule and rooted in his Catholic faith. However, his policies alienated the country’s Buddhist majority, who made up over 70% of the population.

In 1963, tensions reached a boiling point when Diem's government banned the display of Buddhist flags during Vesak, Buddha’s birthday celebration. This sparked protests across South Vietnam, most notably in the city of Huế, where nine peaceful demonstrators were killed by government forces. The incident enraged Buddhists and intensified their grievances against Diem's regime, which they saw as discriminatory and authoritarian. Diệm and his supporters blamed the Việt Cộng for the deaths and claimed the protesters were responsible for the violence. Although the provincial chief expressed sorrow for the killings and offered to compensate the victims' families, they resolutely denied that government forces were responsible for the killings and blamed the Viet Cong. According to Diệm, it was the communists who threw a grenade into the crowd.

The crisis escalated when Buddhist leaders organized widespread protests and hunger strikes. The most shocking moment came on June 11, 1963, when Thích Quảng Đức, a Buddhist monk, set himself on fire at a busy Saigon intersection. Photographs of his self-immolation circulated worldwide, exposing the brutality and unpopularity of Diem's government.

Instead of addressing the grievances, Diem and his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, responded with increased repression, raiding pagodas and arresting monks. This further alienated both domestic and international supporters. The United States, initially supportive of Diem, began questioning his leadership as the crisis deepened. 

Madame Nhu Trần Lệ Xuân, Nhu's wife, inflamed the situation by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, ""If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I will be glad to supply the gasoline."" The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in Saigon. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and the closure of the university; this was repeated at Huế University. When high school students demonstrated, Diệm arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Diệm's foreign minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving his head like a Buddhist monk in protest. When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest.

By November 1963, Diem's inability to resolve the Buddhist crisis, coupled with broader discontent, led to a U.S.-backed coup.

At some point he started saving jews by having them work in his factories. He did everything he could and is recognized as a “righteous amongst nations”

Kastner was a jew in Hungary that did try to save a lot of jews, and organized a train that is known as the Kastner train. However there was and still is evidence that he served as an informant for the nazis, and had various other connections.
Some historians say that he was a willing informant, others think that he thought he could use and outsmart his nazi contacts. 

In Israel, he underwent a trial in which it was said that he has aided the extermination of tens of thousands of Hungarian jews for the organization of the train which saved ~1,300 from the wealthiest and the most prominent members of the community, and that he failed to inform the Hungarian jews of the holocaust that was coming to them. In 1957 he was murdered while appealing the previous inditement.

Up to this day there are conflicted feelings about Kastner and his colleagues.


However, Yad Vashem apparently connects Kastners activism during the war to the rescue of some 20,000 Hungarian jews.|Hey I met someone who was on the Kastner Train.

[Emanuel Mandel](https://www.ushmm.org/remember/holocaust-survivors/volunteers/emanuel-manny-mandel)|As with most things in WW2, people's morality was tested to the extreme, and there's plenty of figures doing unorthodox things that might've saved considerable number of lives, but would be considered incredibly morally contentious.

The Kastner train is a perfect example of this. Kastner was aware of Jews being exterminated en masse - it was an 'open secret' among those in the know. In an opportunity that would've seemed unthinkable both Himmler and Eichmann authorised a small trainload of Jews to be transported out of harm's way in Hungary to neutral Switzerland.  This seems completely contradictory to what was simultaneously occurring (it certainly was), considering that Hungarian Jews were being deported in their 100,000s to Auschwitz, to be gassed on arrival. For both Himmler and Eichmann though, the transport was, in a sense, a form of negotiating tactic to show good faith to the Western allies. They were aware that Germany was losing the war, and so naturally they were thinking of their futures. However, it should be stressed that they both didn't do this out of some genuine humanitarian purposes - they were still believers in the Final Solution - but as I said, they did it as a negotiating tactic.

After a series of negotiations, Kastner was able to arrange a transport of around 1600 Hungarian Jews. However, the contentious part comes during this. The positions on this train was done by ransom as the Nazis still wanted to plunder Jewish wealth during the process, so it favored wealthy Jews. Additionally, there's evidence of corruption as people who were related to Kastner - family, friends, and colleagues - were able to secure spots over others. Kastner was also accused of not informing Hungarian Jewry of their impending murders. This made him a controversial figure among Holocaust survivors (reminds at least somewhat to Chaim Rukomski in terms of tarnished reputation, though he is far more contentious than Kastner). Kastner himself stated that on the latter accusation of failing to inform Hungarian Jewry he said it would've been counterproductive and would've prevented saving Jews like he did.

Kastner's fate after the war was a sad one. He went on trial and was eventually assassinated.

The lessons I take at the end of day during this period was that the Nazis put Jews in impossible moral situations: it broke people's common moral compasses, their bonds with their communities, strained family and friendly ties to the extremes, and ultimately made Jews make choices between life or death on a daily basis. Kastner is one such person: a likely well meaning man who did think he was saving some Jews from imminent death (he did save 1600 in the end), only put in this position because the Nazis deliberated created such unthinkable circumstances.|I think the difference in people's minds so early after WWII/the Holocaust was that Kasztner was himself Jewish, while Schindler wasn't. But his end was unfair, as I see it today. Had he lived more, I think people's view and treatment of him would have been different, with more research on his ties with Nazi officials.|https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Rumkowski

Is also an interesting character.

He turned the Getto he lead into the most productive one, ensuring the Nazis have a reason to keep it and resulting in his Getto having some of the lowest mortality rate.

It's still debated if his actions were in the right or not.

He is most well known for give me your children speech

>A grievous blow has struck the ghetto. They [the Germans] are asking us to give up the best we possess – the children and the elderly. I was unworthy of having a child of my own, so I gave the best years of my life to children. I've lived and breathed with children. I never imagined I would be forced to deliver this sacrifice to the altar with my own hands. In my old age, I must stretch out my hands and beg: Brothers and sisters! Hand them over to me! Fathers and mothers: Give me your children!

— Chaim Rumkowski, September 4, 1942|Did they save lives? Yes, that is all that's important.|Schindler was equally controversial during his lifetime, usually keeping a low profile only gaining recognition after his death with the people he saved advocating for his burial in Jerusalem. Only after the relese of the book in the 80s and the movie in 93 was his image truly rehabilitated.

Meanwhile, kastner lived in Israel surrounded by survivors and victims families who wanted any closure and justice they could find. There were several trials in Israel in the 50s and 60s held against israelis who during the war were kappos. All of those ended shortly after the eichman trial showed the country who the real monsters were. Kastner also didn't exactly kept a low profile, he was a memeber of the ruling worker's party and was a press secretary to the ministry of commerce. If he wasn't assassinated he probably would have been rehabilitated if not for people like Ben hecht, a Hollywood screenwriter, who wrote a novel about kastner. In truth, the same Hollywood who made Schindler a hero is the one that made kastner a villain.|In high school we had a teacher who would sometimes start the day with teaching us about an important historical event that happened on that day.

\~ Mary Beard|Scipio was a great general but he was not Hannibal.

If Hannibal had the full support of the Carthaginian empire behind him he would have won.|I'd say a big reason to consider Scipio even better than Hannibal is his armies disposition as well. Rome lost so many men at the battle Canae and the other proceeding battles when Scipio was made proconsul and left for Iberia his army wasn't exactly the best quality, being made up of former slaves, the very young, and whoever Rome could spare while their campaign to keep Hannibal contained in the south of Italy, as much of their more experienced, ideal legions had been slaughtered. He was bolstered by the Iberian tribes who came to his side, but he still had an uphill battle in Iberia with second rate troops and he still managed what Hannibal could not, that being defeating multiple Carthagian armies and even taking the regional capital of Nova Carthago.|Negative, he had years to study Hannibal and come up with a specific strategy to defeat Hannibal…|In my opinion I don't think Hannibal could ever have taken Rome. Sure he could make people turn traitor, but if he wasn't in charge of every battle he'd eventually just run out of men. We saw this after Cannae where others took advantage and got their ass whooped. Which is why former traitors decided to go back to Rome. Hannibal is certainly a great general no doubt about it and scipio really did take his notes well and is arguably better as he did what took Hannibal entire life in two years. Now I will say this I don't believe in the great person theory of history that one person is just so great it's destined to be as so many times you can see how it all could've gone down the drain. Hannibal I think is proof of that as yes he was a great person, yes he did defy the odds, but the reason why he didn't achieve his goal is simple. It's lack of support from Carthage, and for his strategy to work he'd have to be everywhere. Which sure to the Roman's it sure seemed like that hell I'm Italian and I'm not sure if Hannibal has been dressing up as my wife in disguise, but that's beside the point that one general usually can't tackle a nation. Unless you're Alexander or Napoleon but Alexander is a bit of an oddity as he was way ahead of the curve, and Napoleon despite being emperor of France was a great Italian general that was also ahead of his time both off and on the battlefield as using cold war tactics on Britain in the early 1800s was crazy. You're welcome France|No, Hannibal fought against Rome, the most disciplined snd professional force of their time.

Scipio was fighting Hannibal and Carthage at their weakest which comprised mostly of mercenaries and levied soldiers.

They were both great, but Hannibal was fighting against a significantly greater enemy for far longer and still never lost. It was Carthage that ended up being his undoing, whereas Rome never posed any obstacles for Scipio.|Fabian walked so Scipio could run, dont @ me|Hannibal was able to match scipio while disadvantaged without his Numidian calvary and having his elephants basically ineffective only losing the battle because the calvary returned just in time. Also copying someone doesn’t make them better. He certainly was the best Roman general of the time though again cause he copied someone.

Also this meme implies that Hannibal **is** better cause bloodsport kills peacemaker.|While Both Hannibal and Scipio were comparable tactically speaking (Both defeating enemy armies much larger, Hannibal winning Cannea and Scipio winning both Zama and llipa) but Scipio was just a much better strategist.

He understood the importance of actually TAKING cities and territories to win a war while Hannibal was far too content with just winning field battles which prevented him from even taking advantage of his wins.|You probably just saw Oversimplified video drop|Scipio was great but he wasn't as good as Hannibal.

What began as a forbidden affair would culminate in a dramatic series of events that saw Inês brutally murdered on royal orders and Pedro, upon ascending the throne, exacting a chilling retribution that would etch their love story into the annals of history.

In the early days of the French 3rd Republic (1870-1940), the liberal establishment faced a pretty significant challenge from the Boulangists, a loose political grouping pre-proto-fascists. Although they were eventually defeated, the Boulangists attracted the support of some Blanquists, a peculiar far-left philosophy that wanted to come to power through a coup, and to impose a revolution from above

Meanwhile, the liberal establishment kinda got the support of some Marxists and former Parisian Communards, through their denouncement of the Boulangists, which is ironic, given how the brutally the Commune was suppressed by the establishment.

Imagining a hypothetical conflict between Mahmud of Ghazni and Rajendra Chola I is intriguing, as both were formidable leaders in their respective regions during the 11th century.

Mahmud of Ghazni

Background: Mahmud (971–1030) was the ruler of the Ghaznavid Empire(Somewhere in present day Afghanistan) and is known for his military campaigns into the Indian subcontinent, particularly targeting wealthy temples and cities.
Military Strengths: He had a well-trained army, including a strong cavalry. His strategies often involved surprise attacks and rapid movements, allowing him to conquer and plunder effectively.
Tactics: He was adept at using siege warfare and took advantage of the disunity among Indian states during his campaigns.

Rajendra Chola I

Background: Rajendra Chola I (c. 1014–1044) was one of the greatest rulers of the Chola dynasty, known for expanding the Chola Empire across South India and Southeast Asia. Rajendra Chola wanted the holy water of the River Ganges (which is in the north of India near the Himalayas) to perform rituals for the inauguration of his new Capital city.  All the other kingdoms refused to make way for his expedition so Rajendra Chola I, invaded every east coast kingdom along the way to get the water of The River Ganges.
Historians believe it was the same time around the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazini. 

Military Strengths: He commanded a powerful navy and had a highly organized army, known for their discipline and effective use of war elephants.
Tactics: Rajendra was innovative in his military strategies, including amphibious assaults, which allowed him to project power across the Indian Ocean.
Hypothetical Outcome

Terrain: The outcome would heavily depend on the terrain. Mahmud's strengths lay in his ability to conduct raids and battles in North India, while Rajendra’s strengths were in the southern regions and coastal areas.
Naval Power: Rajendra's naval capabilities could provide him an advantage if the conflict extended to coastal regions or involved maritime strategies.
Cultural and Political Context: Both leaders operated in different cultural and political contexts. Mahmud's campaigns were often against fragmented states, while Rajendra faced more organized resistance in the South.",HistoryMemes,1i84e5x

The French Battalion in Korea, formed in 1950, was composed of volunteers who joined the United Nations forces during the Korean War. The ranks included reservists, voluntary enlistees, and individuals who chose service over imprisonment. Despite their small numbers (about 1,100 soldiers), they distinguished themselves through acts of bravery, particularly in battles like Twin Tunnels and Chipyong-ni, where they held their ground against vastly superior forces. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Monclar, they faced extreme conditions, including the bitter cold of the mountains. Their courage was recognized with three U.S. Presidential Unit Citations and two citations from the Republic of Korea.

Notably, a French section exists in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, where 44 French soldiers are buried ( [un Mémorial Cemetery in korea]( https://g.co/kgs/SV59sqR). The soldiers were also granted leave in Japan, where they could briefly escape the horrors of war. In bustling streets, they found a short respite before returning to the front. 

It is also documented that allied units, such as the 77th Squadron of the Air Force and the 3rd Infantry Battalion, stationed in Japan as part of the occupation forces, participated in the Korean War at the UN's request. Night fighters, helicopters, and B-29 bombers based in Okinawa also played a role in the conflict.

The light of my life has gone out|1878 was a bit of a turbulent year for Theodore Roosevelt. His father died, he went on the first of many legendary treks with Bill Sewall, AND he fell in love for the first time. The object of his desire was one [Alice Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Hathaway_Lee_Roosevelt), and Teddy was horrendously smitten. From skipping teaching Sunday School, to writing to her asking for more letters, to riding his horse so often to see her that it went lame, the man was eager to win her over to say the least. He did include other women in his activities to “play it cool”, including Alice’s neighbor, Rose. He’d buy gifts for both of them whenever he saw them, which was quite pricey. “Those two ladies have cost me over $150 so far”, adjusted for inflation that’s a whopping $4,734. He very nearly considered cancelling another trip with Sewall just to have more time to see her, but his love of the outdoors won out in that instance.

Even after his horse was out of commission, he still made the 6 mile trip from Cambridge on foot just to see her. When it did recover, he trained it to pull an exquisite Dogcart, essentially pulling up in the 19th century version of a Lamborghini. All of these efforts drew so much attention, that an acquaintance of his, Owen Wister, penned a [popular poem](https://imgur.com/a/LN3wv9H) essentially roasting Teddy for being a Simp.

He didn't go in the normal S movement to make it harder for submarines to hit the ship. The Japanese submarine captain wrote a letter saying that because the ship was travelling alone, making such manoeuvres would have been pointless. The US captain did the logical choice and tried to get his ship out of hostile waters as soon as possible.

Do not quote me on this, been years since I read up on the topic.|There's so much I could not fit in the meme of the horrors of Indianapolis. 



\- The USS Indianapolis was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine on July 30, 1945 after completing the delivery of components of 'Little Boy' to Tinian Naval Base

\- In an attempt to save the ship crewmates were forced to seal off rooms filled with their comrades begging to be saved, this didn't stop the ship from sinking within 12 minutes.

\- There are reports of people jumping off the ship only to land into rudders which were still spinning. The force of the ship sinking created a mega amount of suction bringing people with or without life vests into dangerous depths of the ocean. Those with life vests were shot a few metres into the air upon resurfacing. 

\- The rapid sinking left no time to send a distress signal, leaving survivors stranded in the open ocean without immediate hope for rescue.

\- Survivors swallowed a mixture of oil and saltwater as they struggled to stay afloat, causing severe nausea, vomiting, and further dehydration.

\- Many sailors suffered broken bones, deep cuts, loss of limbs, severe burns in the unforgiving salt water. I believe there was a case of 5 people trying to keep a comrade above water whilst they were all treading water.

\- When day came survivors were exposed to the scorching sun with little to no water, leading to dehydration, hallucinations, and madness.

\- Up to a 150 survivors were attacked and killed by oceanic whitetip sharks, drawn to the wreckage by blood and movement.

\- At 10:25 on 2 August, a PV-1 Ventura flown by Lieutenant Wilbur ""Chuck"" Gwinn and his copilot, Lieutenant Warren Colwell, and a PBY-2 Catalina piloted by Bill Kitchen spotted the men adrift while on a routine patrol flight.

\- Only 316 of the 890 men set adrift after the sinking survived.

\- While many of Indianapolis's survivors said Captain Charles B. McVay was not to blame for the sinking, the families of some of the men who died thought otherwise: ""Merry Christmas! Our family's holiday would be a lot merrier if you hadn't killed my son"", read one piece of mail.\[38\] The guilt that was placed on his shoulders mounted until he killed himself in 1968, aged 70|Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief.

315,How I unleashed World War Zero (context in the comments) ,https://i.redd.it/yu6rd3stobee1.png,767,2025-01-21 15:49:54,34,"CONTEXT!!!  
George Washington, who was a 22-year old lieutenant colonel at the time, was stationed in OHIO, which was a contested territory between the French and the British. The French begun construction of a fort in the area. After learning about the whereabouts of the French forces, Washington and his troops prepared an ambush. What enfolded was the so called Battle of Jumonville Glen, where Washington’s small force of Virginians and Indian allies killed the French, including their commander Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, who had been carrying a diplomatic message for the British…. OOPS! The French later found their countrymen dead and scalped, blaming Washington, who had retreated to Fort Necessity. Aaaand this is how this skirmish led to an undeclared war in the Americas between the French and the British called the French and Indian War, which became a declared war two years later, better known as the Seven Years’ War. That war involved more powers, most notably United Kingdom and Prussia on one side, and France, Austria, Sweden and Russia on the other. Because it involved so many great powers and because this war was fought over several continents (Europe, America, Asia, Africa), it has been referred by modern historians as the true first world war.

Meme is a reference to a 3-part polish war comedy called “How I Unleashed World War II” where the protagonist, private Franek Dolas, believes he caused the war as he happened to fire a shot just before the Germans launched their attack on Poland.

Pritchard's Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament highlights these parallels, though he stops short of suggesting direct borrowing. Similarly Egyptologist Donald B. Redford propose that Psalm 104 might reflect a broader Near Eastern tradition of creation hymns rather than direct dependence on Aten’s hymn (Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times). The psalm’s monotheistic tone aligns more closely with Hebrew theology than the Aten hymn's focus on a solar deity.

Conclusion: 

While there is various similarities scholarships consensus is the evidence dosnt support the idea of borrowing. Rather reflects shared themes prevalent in ancient Near Eastern religious literature, adapted to fit the distinct theological frameworks of their respective cultures.

329,Surely the Italians won't go to war like this,https://i.redd.it/t4p9nzmyo4ee1.jpeg,12266,2025-01-20 16:16:28,121,"This was largely due to a one-two punch of Italian leadership, Italian industry, and a doctrine developed during colonial wars.

The Italian leadership, particularly Mussolini, were pretty gung-ho about warfare, many of them still remembering the bitter stalemate at the Isonzo River but also wanting to avenge their national honor for the ""disrespect"" at Versailles and the interwar period.

Italian industry was, however, pretty weak, falling way behind many European powers, and they could ill afford to build a sea of medium tanks the way the Germans or even the French could. Light tanks and tankettes formed the large bulk of their armored forces.

The colonial war doctrine basically came about from using armor, air power and artillery against backwards African armies that had none, complimented with the use of poison gas and chemical weapons against both enemy combatants and civilians alike. They tried replicating the feat in Spain against the Republicans, but the Republicans were in general better armed and prepared against it, and the Italians couldn't just use poison gas against Europeans the way they could against Africans. They lost a fair chunk of their equipment during the Spanish Civil War, and were still trying to rebuild it when the Germans invaded Poland.

France's crappy doctrine was the result of a deeply divided military, and a country still recovering from the trauma of the First World War. They were betting all in on a defensive war, fought like it was 20 years ago. Newer innovations, like radio or improved engines, were stalled by old leadership with stagnant imaginations.

The Germans, by contrast, wanted revenge, and knew they couldn't afford a long-running war, so focused everything on making the best use of armor and combined arms in quick, decisive military operations, and had the officer and commander cadres to match.|“This is the L33 Carro Veloce, it’s a carro that goes veloce”|Tbh, at the start of the war the tanks was pretty modern, but the situation escalated quick.|Ah, the P26/40—Italy's most advanced tank design, a project that starkly revealed the systemic issues plaguing the country during the war.

Development began in 1940, underwent significant revisions after the Italians encountered the T-34 on the Eastern Front. By the time of Italy's surrender in September 1943, however, only FIVE P26/40 tanks had been produced.

The P26/40 wasn’t some groundbreaking *Wunderwaffe*; it was a rough equivalent to the T-34 or Sherman. Italy, unlike island nations like Japan, directly felt the urgent need for better tanks after clashing with Soviet armor. Yet, despite more than two years of effort, they managed to produce just five. (tbf, Italy under Nazi occupation produced more than 100 of them, most without engine)|The Greeks will raid the Italian tanks|Modernize your army first to go out of the economic crisis.

Italian army in a nutshell.|Let's be real here. Germany had some modern tanks in 1940, but the biggest part of their forces were light tanks that weren't good for much more than scouting and certainly weren't made to be the armored spearhead.

Germany had about 2500 tanks, which broke down to: 554 Pz I , 920 Pz II , 349 Pz III , 280 Pz IV, 118 Pz 35 and 207 Pz 38 (the latter two being spoils of war from the occupation of Czechoslovakia). Of those the PZ 1s were obsolete trainer tanks with nothing but machine guns for armament (in the UK and Italy they'd have been classed as tankettes) and the Pz IIs were light tanks meant for scouting armed with a 20mm autocannon. 

On paper the flawed French tanks were still better than most tanks that Germany had, but it was poor tactics and leadership that made them much worse. Germany used its largely inferior tank forces much more effectively, with better leadership and operational and tactical doctrine.|So you are telling me, that a 1920s tank design that was very unreliable, had a one men turret and bad radio was a modern tank? Sorry but thats like trying to sell T 72s in 2024 and saying its the king of any battlefield|I would count a tank as ""modern"" if it actually had radio and didn't use flags to communicate.|I mean... Modern *ish* for France.

Don't get me wrong, France fought *hard* with what they had and got impressive results under the circumstances (their pilots maintained a positive kill ratio through the whole invasion for example), but while their armor was *arguably* better than Italy's it wasn't really as good as Germany's.

> Thomas Custer was the first soldier in U.S. history to be given two Medals of Honor for two distinct and separate acts of valor.

> During the Civil War, Custer was just 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the Union infantry before commissioning as a cavalry officer. He was awarded his first Medal of Honor for a charge led against an enemy barricade at the Battle of Namozine Church in Virginia.

> On April 3, 1865, at just 20 years old, he took 14 prisoners and managed to snatch the Confederate flag from its holder’s hands — creating chaos for the enemy, according to Defense Department records.

> A mere three days after, Custer captured two more flags during the Battle of Sailor’s Creek. As he led the charge, his horse was shot and killed from under him, but he kept going. He was wounded and taken to a local hospital, records indicate. This was the second campaign for which Custer was awarded the Medal of Honor, making him the first ever soldier to receive the military’s highest honor twice.

> Throughout U.S. history, 19 total troops have received two Medals of Honor, according to the Defense Department.

https://www.wearethemighty.com/mighty-history/george-custers-brother-earned-two-medals-of-honor/
> It’s funny how the older Custer can be so infamous for his worst military blunder, while his brother Thomas Ward can earn two Medals of Honor and practically be lost to history.

> “If you want to know what I think of him, all I can say, Tom ought to have been the general and I the captain,” so says Gen. George Armstrong Custer, who was probably right.

> Thomas Ward Custer would die with his big brother at Little Bighorn and wouldn’t achieve the rank and notoriety of the elder Custer. He was a good soldier (to put it mildly) enlisting at age 16 to fight in the Civil War and fighting in the major battles of Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and in the Atlanta Campaign. He was enlisted for most of the war before earning a commission in October 1864.

> Barely six months later — April 3, 1865 — the younger Custer captured a Confederate Regimental flag at Namozine Church. He did it after being wounded and thrown from his horse. He also took at least a dozen prisoners to boot.

> Capturing an enemy flag was a big deal at the time of the Civil War. If a unit’s flag was captured, there was a good chance the unit’s cohesion would just fall apart. They were held in the middle of the unit and troops looked to them for assurance during the fighting – the assurance that the rest of the unit was still fighting with them.

> Three days later, Thomas Ward captured another regiment’s colors at Saylor’s Creek, jumping from his horse during a cavalry charge, over and into the enemy lines. He was wounded in the face for his trouble and awarded his second Medal of Honor. ...",HistoryMemes,1i6f9eb

**Our friend here is Isabel II of Spain (or Isabella II as she is sometimes called in english) and she was Queen of Spain from 1833 until her deposition in 1868**, having ascended to the throne at just 3 years old, as the eldest of the two daughters of King Fernando VII of Spain.

Isabella II was married at the age of 16 (literally on her 16th birthday) to her double first cousin, the Duke of Cadiz and future king consort, Francisco de Asís de Borbón, whose homosexuality was quite evident and recognized at the time (he had a whole collection of unfriendly nicknames about it)

 So... despite Isabel had a total of 12 pregnancies during their marriage (of which 5 children lived past infancy) and while her husband, the king consort, officially recognized all of the children as his, the most likely thing is that none were biologically his, including the future King Alfonso XII of Spain, Isabel's only son who survived infancy (the other four were all girls) and from whom the current King of Spain, Felipe VI, is a descendet (he is the great-great-grandfather of Felipe VI, making Isabel II his great-great-great-grandmother)

It is even said that during one mother and son argument between Isabel II and the future Alfonso XII, she told him: ""What you have of Bourbon, you have it because of me"" (Lo que tienes de Borbón lo tienes por mi) speaking of the fact that his ""royal blood"" was exclusively because of her, both she and her husband, the king consort, being members of the same dynasty, the Bourbon royal dynasty, that has reigned in Spain since 1700 and up until this day (with a few exiles in between but who is counting those?)

Whatever gender Elagabalus identified as is unknown. What *is* known is that they were widely despised and considered overly ""Eastern"", which in Roman culture meant ""effeminate"" and ""religiously weird."" Almost all the historical evidence has to be read in that lens - and you need to understand that for the Romans, a man cross-dressing and basically whoring themselves is peak shit-talking. 


It was standard practice in Rome for historians to smear unpopular monarchs after their death, to the point where most of Caligula and Nero's excesses are considered suspect since the evidence of them came from parties seeking to delegitimise both of them after the fact. Elagabalus is no different. Whatever they actually were or did, their depiction as ""trans"" was recorded with the understanding that it was a gross insult to Roman sensibilities. The validity of it is therefore highly questionable - right up there with Catherine the Great fucking a horse.|The point of these comparisons to to debunk the extremely common myth that Trans people are a new thing, not to say they where more or less moral then other people of their time.|Elagabalus most likely wasn't even trans

So when you see him in character chasing beautiful gals, it was his way to turn a personal tragedy into comedy material (as he's not the only male character being beaten when doing inappropriated acts). Women in Benny Hill universe are out of reach creatures able to be cunning and smart enough to retaliate against agressions (so not totally objectified), but there are ""happy"" moments when he leaves with two on each side as Hill still was a lovable and supportive artist towards his female co-stars.

First, this is a huge misleading shortcuts on the facts leading to the events. (It had shit ton of communication issues between language barrier and malfunction in technologies, plus british and french admirals assholiness, but mainly, the french navy had to surrender their ships to the royal navy, not just go to the UK, which was unacceptable for any admiral).
Then, it led around 1200 French sailors' deaths, not just 4!!!! (if I remember correctly, around 2000 casualties total) . It did not slightly strained the french british relationship it fucked them up. It was one of the best propaganda opportunity for Germany!

355,Turns out the Media is stronger than Communism,https://i.redd.it/7c3kpjbhr4ee1.png,520,2025-01-20 16:30:47,16,"The 1996 presidential election in the Russian Federation was an important milestone in the country's political history, being the first presidential election outside the USSR. At the beginning of 1996, Boris Yeltsin, the incumbent president, faced extremely low ratings that ranged from 3 to 9% due to economic setbacks and failures in Chechnya. At the same time, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, enjoyed the support of about 30% of voters, making him the clear favorite.

With Zyuganov's victory increasingly threatened, oligarchs such as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Potanin, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky rallied around Yeltsin. At the Davos Economic Forum in early 1996, they decided to support the president, realizing the risk of a return to communist power. This alliance became critical to forming a powerful financial and media base for Yeltsin.

With the start of the election campaign in February 1996, the oligarchs began to actively use their media resources to create a negative image of Zyuganov. The main TV channels and newspapers were controlled by the businessmen, which allowed them to shape public opinion. As a result, Zyuganov was constantly criticized and discredited, while Yeltsin gained an advantage in the media space. Political technologists such as Gleb Pavlovsky developed “black PR” strategies that worked effectively against the opponent, painting Zyuganov's prospects for victory in the blackest colors, recalling all the worst elements of the Soviet Union. This was compounded by the fact that many media employees were themselves anti-communists by conviction, so even though they disliked Yeltsin, they unequivocally opposed Zyuganov.



As the election approached, Yeltsin's ratings began to rise thanks to the active support of the oligarchs and manipulation of public opinion. By mid-May 1996, he had surpassed Zyuganov in electoral indicators for the first time. In the first round of elections on June 16, Yeltsin won 35.32% of the vote to Zyuganov's 32.03%, necessitating a second round.

In the second round of elections on July 3, 1996, Boris Yeltsin won with 53.82% of the vote against Zyuganov's 40.31%. This victory was achieved not only due to the funding and media support of the oligarchs, but also due to the active mobilization of voters. Also important was the appointment of Alexander Lebed as Secretary of the Security Council after the first round, which helped attract his supporters to vote for Yeltsin.



Thus, the 1996 elections became an example of how the consolidation of elites and control over the media made it possible to achieve success using dirty methods of political struggle, but without obvious falsifications (as individual studies show, such falsifications did take place, but they were committed in favor of both candidates, while in both cases such falsifications were extremely insufficient to significantly change the election results, since even according to the most daring estimates, in the second round the number of ballots thrown in for one of the candidates was less than a million, while the final difference between the candidates was 10 million votes).|Vote or you'll lose!!!|To be fair, it was probably less due to control over the media and more due to control over the vote counting.",HistoryMemes,1i5nqog

Bhutan|#ROMA EST AETERNA|More like successor to the holy Roman empire|Jokes aside, it would be an interesting thing to wonder upon, how could the EU be a Roman State successor. 

In my view, the Greek State is the direct state successor of the Roman State, [through the Maniot State](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/comments/1ee38xw/comment/lfbb41c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). As such, one could claim that right now the European Union has included the Roman State in its fold since 1981. But would that render the whole of the European Union into a successor state of the Roman State? I am inclined to say no, for still the EU is essentially a political union, a close alliance of cooperation between different member-states, who still maintain their statehood, even if they have slightly limited their sovereignty. We have seen many examples of EU member-states which have gone against EU decisions and have done their own thing, or have even conducted foreign affairs and decisions of external policy that are against the ones commonly decided on an EU level. 

Therefore, perhaps the EU could only be seen as a Roman State successor if it became even more united, not just as a European Federation, but as a common European State, where all former member-states have willingly merged into a single statehood. But that seems quite impossible, as that would essentially require the formation of a Pan-European identity as ""European"" first, and the member-state's identity becoming a mere regional identity (like how in Ancient Greece they placed their state's or tribe's identity before their common Greekness, until the Roman Empire which rendered all such state or tribal identities into mere regional identities), and to forsake their languages for the sake of a common Pan-European language ( using something like Esperanto). And pretty much nobody would be willing to do that, especially Greece, where in a study of 2024 about 35% view the participation of Greece in the EU as something negative, 36% deem the EU as unreliable and just 14% believe it will become a European Federation, with 40% saying it will just remain as it is, and 37% expecting member-states to leave.|Like the IRA and its offshoots, the EU is the “latest” iteration of the Roman Empire… just that its de-facto HQ is in Berlin|But the centre is the barbaric swampland……Wait.

In June 1888, after the death of both his grandfather and father earlier that year, Wilhelm II became German Kaiser. A showdown with the aging Bismarck, who had been appointed Prussian minister president in 1862, became more likely with each passing month. One bone of contention between the two men was social policy, which had become acutely sensitive in the wake of massive strikes in 1889. In January 1890, Wilhelm II developed plans to implement better protection for workers and decided that a conference should be held to discuss the issues involved. These intentions are outlined in the royal decree Wilhelm sent to Bismarck on February 4, excerpted below. Because Bismarck at this time was steering toward a showdown with workers—one designed to make him indispensable to the young Kaiser—a different sort of crisis occurred, leading to Bismarck’s dismissal on March 18, 1890


Wilhelm the 2nd's letter discussing it:

I am resolved to lend a hand in improving the situation of German workers within the limits that have been drawn on account of the need to keep German industry competitive on the world market and to thus secure the livelihood of workers. The decline of domestic enterprises due to the loss of foreign sales would not only cost entrepreneurs but also workers their livelihood. International competition is the root cause of the difficulties involved in improving our workers’ situation, and these difficulties can only be diminished, if not entirely overcome, through international agreement between those countries that share in the domination of the world market. Convinced that other governments are also inspired by the wish to subject these efforts to joint examination, an examination already undertaken by the workers of these countries in the course of international negotiations, I would like, as a start, for My diplomatic representatives in France, England, Belgium, and Switzerland to officially inquire as to whether those governments would be inclined to enter into negotiations with us for the purpose of an international agreement on the possibility of making concessions regarding the needs and wishes of workers that have come to light through the strikes of recent years. As soon as assent to My suggestion has been reached in principle, I commission you to invite the cabinets of all governments taking an equal interest in the workers’ question to a conference for the purpose of consultation on the relevant questions.

Wilhelm I. R. [King and Kaiser]

Also yeah, maybe the collective power of the workers forced the hand of leadership, as it very often does when it gains enough power, just like any other interest group. This sorta crackdown doesn't really happen in countries without powerful worker's movements, and Germany had, at that point in time, a very powerful socialist (explicitly marxist) movement in the SPD.

As for the SPD's inability to act directly, that's because the german parliament just wasn't very powerful- it was a concession, formed and allowed to exist but still subservient to the military.

An outsider, who had previously only had private tutors to teach him, having actual classmates that weren’t his siblings was a whole lot new experience. Undeterred, he was very outgoing in making new friends and asking others to attend physical activities alongside him. 

One classmate, Richard Welling, accepted Roosevelt’s offer to go skating one afternoon. Describing the young Roosevelt as “verily a youth in the kindergarten stage of physical development”, he assumed that it’d be a trivial affair. To his shock, Roosevelt chose a rough, unprotected skating area, and proceeded to skate with glee until the sun went down. Adding to Welling’s discomfort, Roosevelt repeatedly exclaimed “Isn’t this bully!” throughout the entire ordeal.

405,Ancient problems require human sacrifice solutions,https://i.redd.it/ffi0vfhkwqde1.png,9546,2025-01-18 18:08:04,78,"During the second Punic War, Hannibal famously crossed the Alps and wreaked havoc in Ancient Rome. Since he couldn't siege Rome, because the city was too big and well defended, he instead roamed the Roman countryside with his army.

During this time, in 216 BC, he surrounded and practically annihilated a larger Roman and Italian army under the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro at the Battle of Cannae. It is regarded as one of the greatest tactical feats in military history and one of the worst defeats in Roman history, and it cemented Hannibal's reputation as one of antiquity's greatest tacticians.

According to ancient sources, the Romans lost between 67,000 and 80,000 soldiers in a single day during the battle. In total, since Hannibal had crossed the Alps 20 months prios, Rome had lost about 20% of its entire male population above the age of 17. For reference, 29.2% of Nazi Germany's soldiers died over the duration of WW2, which lasted 6 years.

Now these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt and modern scholars think that they are too high. Their estimates put the casualities at about half or a third of what ancient sources claim.

Still, the Romans were in complete disarray, since their best armies had been destroyed. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there was not a single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).

The morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal's cause. Hannibal sent a delegation led by Carthalo to negotiate a peace treaty with the Senate on moderate terms. Despite the multiple catastrophes Rome had suffered, the Senate refused to parley. Instead, they redoubled their efforts, declaring full mobilization of the male Roman population, and raised new legions, enlisting landless peasants and even slaves. So firm were these measures that the word ""peace"" was prohibited, mourning was limited to only 30 days, and public tears were prohibited even to women.

14 years later Rome won the Battle of Zama, after which Carthage capitulated. This ended the Second Punic War.

It's just a coincidence, I posted my meme a few hours before the video was released.|This was very coincidental post timing|You see, all of this can be explained very easy.

It wasn’t just that they were really, really difficult to beat on the battlefield (although they were), or that even victories over them were almost always insanely attritional (although that was the case too). 


It's that they would *never stop*. Defeat a field army? They'd regroup and come at you again. Destroy an army in its entirety along with the generals? The Republic would just raise another, even bigger, one that would be marching on you within the next campaign season. 


You not only had to beat them, you had to keep on beating them.

Among the most powerful, if not the most powerful in actuality was that of Cao Shuang, son of Cao Zhen, a past major Wei general, and that of Sima Yi. Yes, that Sima Yi. Now, Cao Shuang was looking for a way to boost his prestige. He settled for invading the nation of Shu Han, founded by Liu Bei. A few decades ago Liu Bei had wrested the area of Hanzhong from Cao Cao, and it was hoped that even if they couldn't conquer the entire state, just conquering Hanzhong would be enough to boost his fame and power.

Now, the border between Shu Han and Wei is extremely mountainous, a chief cause of the famous supply problems faced by Zhuge Liang. As such, they had to choose the routes carefully. Cao Shuang chose to use the shortest route. However, while this route was the shortest, it not only had the fewest water sources but had the longest stretch without any water source of any route.

The invasion was a disaster. Thousands of pack animals died en masse of thirst and exhaustion, and rather than seeing this early warning sign for what it was, they simply pressed many new recruits into carrying the supplies instead. Predictably, being forced to carry the loads of oxen and horses caused them to die en masse as well, and this was before even seeing a single Shu Han solder. After a long slogging march, they were then checked, halted dead in their tracks by Shu Han's brilliant defenses and only escaped being destroyed because many generals and advisors, Sima Yi especially wrote warnings informing them if they didn't retreat, they wouldn't live to regret it. 

This invasion ruined Cao Shuang's reputation. It was so bad that it depopulated the entire province, as those pack animals had been pressed into military service and taken from local tribes, who had to relocate. With his prestige ruined and Sima Yi's boosted, it played a part in the Sima clan's future takeover of Wei, culminating in Cao Shuang's death as well years later/|If you know you'll fuck up, might as well fuck up big and land as a prime character into the annals of your land's history.|I just got done reading a book about Alexander the Greats logistics and wonder how much of it can apply here.

Alexander's army, at least at the beginning, had far lower follower to fighter ratio than his contemporaries.

414,Take the Mexico trip,https://i.redd.it/py8ajxzzttde1.jpeg,467,2025-01-19 03:46:07,9,"The catalyst for this scheme was the upcoming fall election in Maryland. There the Democratic governor, Thomas Swann, was trying to oust state Republicans from power with the help of a new state voter registration law which gave thousands of Ex-Confederates in the state the right to vote. In October municipal elections, Baltimore city Republicans resisted this registration law and gained victory. The Governor then declared his intention to remove Republican voter registrars and police commissioners who shielded them for the upcoming November elections. Election violence in Maryland seemed a real possibility. President Johnson wanted to help Swann and the Democrats by sending in federal troops to “keep order.” For the scheme to work, however, he needed the cooperation of the General-in-Chief, and Johnson wasn’t so sure that Grant would go along with this plan.Knowing Grant had immense popularity, he couldn’t just outright replace him. He settled on a plan to send Grant on a diplomatic mission to Mexico and in the meantime bring in General William T. Sherman to Washington to act as a temporary General-in-Chief. Johnson suspected that Sherman would be more favorable to his Reconstruction plans. He also knew that Grant was greatly interested in affairs in Mexico. However, Johnson was soon found out that neither Grant nor Sherman would cooperate. On October 18, 1866 as per Johnson’s request, Grant ordered Sherman to report to Washington but privately conveyed to Sherman his suspicions of Johnson’s intentions. Sherman complained that “the military ought to keep out of quasi-political offices . . . this is some plan to get Grant out of the way, and to get me here, but I will be a party to no such move.” Sherman remained loyal to Grant. 

Johnson tried his best to send Grant to Mexico, yet Grant would have none of it. He was determined to stay in Washington through the November elections. He even cancelled plans to attend the Galena wedding of his aide, Colonel Orville Babcock, explaining, “it will not do for me to leave Washington before the elections.” Regarding Johnson’s request that he go to Mexico, Grant wrote in his excuse to President Johnson, “I have most respectfully to beg to be excused from the duty proposed. It is a diplomatic service for which I am not fitted either by education or taste. It has necessarily to be conducted under the State Department with which my duties do not connect me.” In this Grant cleverly rejected Johnson’s desires citing his duty as a soldier. Johnson tried to get Grant to accede in his request a final time at a cabinet meeting and again Grant refused. When his plan backfired, Johnson sent Sherman to Mexico and Grant remained in Washington, where he monitored events in Baltimore. Johnson pushed for troops to “intervene on the governor’s side to prevent violence” but Grant demurred, insisting that “this would produce the very result intended to be averted.” In the end the election went off peacefully, but Grant’s distrust of Johnson only grew after this attempt to use him for political ends.|God Johnson sucked",HistoryMemes,1i4ixlf

In the 15th and 16th century Byzantine refugees brought books with them. This didn't launch the renaissance which was already on the way, but gave new texts to European thinkers who were hungry for ancient knowledge. That's when Plato was rediscovered for example. This gave birth to Humanism and early modern philosophy, that's when they started to read more ancient languages like Greek and Hebrew.

However, he responded brutally to any opposition to his will and lacked the finesse of his father, Constantine IV.[7] Consequently, he generated enormous opposition to his reign, resulting in his deposition in 695 in a popular uprising. He only returned to the throne in 705 with the help of a Bulgar and Slav army. His second reign was even more despotic than the first, and in 711 he was killed by mutinous soldiers.""

""Ha, Nazi, Schmazi, "" says Wernher von Braun.|Oh wow, a German sounding guy with a dark period that lasted until 1945, I wonder what's up with that.|Wernher von Braun was a German-American aerospace engineer and rocket scientist who had been part of and worked for the Nazi regime and the Allgemeine SS, the main branch of the SS or Schutzstaffel. He was the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in Nazi Germany and had co-developed the V-2 rocket, the first long-range ballistic missile, which was used as a vengeance and terror weapon during the waning years of the Second World War and the Nazis’ downfall. Shortly before the complete defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies, von Braun had fled to the Americans to spare his own life and was subsequently recruited in Operation Paperclip, a clandestine operation by the U.S. officials to bring Nazi scientists like him to the United States. von Braun eventually worked for NASA and became the chief architect of the Saturn V rocket, which was used in the Apollo programme for astronauts like Neil Armstrong to reach the moon.

The Incident at Petrich or the War of the Stray Dog (Greek: Πόλεμος του αδέσποτου σκύλου), was a Greek–Bulgarian crisis in 1925 that resulted in a brief invasion of Bulgaria by Greece near the border town of Petrich after the killing of a Greek captain and a sentry by Bulgarian soldiers. The incident ended after a decision by the League of Nations.

There are two versions of how the incident started.

In the first version, the incident began on October 18 by a Greek soldier running after his dog, which had strayed across the border from Greece at the pass Demir Kapia [bg] on Belasitsa (Belles). It is thus sometimes referred to as the War of the Stray Dog. The border was guarded by Bulgarian sentries, one of whom shot the Greek soldier.

\*Cheering\*

  
(look this sub doesn't allow images, it's the best i could do!)|By a series of oversights Slovenia has no international waters access nor Trieste (it would be its second most populous city if it was in Slovenia today).

1. After WW1 Italy wanted Istria and Dalmatia as those had lots of ethnic Italians. Yugoslavia wanted Trieste as it had lots of ethnic Slovenians. “In exchange” for Italy’s claim on Dalmatia getting denied and instead given to Yugoslavia (gave Yugoslavia Adriatic access), Italy got Trieste and Istria. All is generally well as Slovenians got more coast access through Dalmatia in exchange for giving away Trieste (not a terrible “deal” from a land perspective, though ethnic Slovenes and other Yugoslavian peoples in Istria and Trieste didn’t fare well in Facist Italy).

2. After WW2 all of Italian Istria (except Trieste) was given to Yugoslavia. Most of Yugoslavian Istria was assigned to Croatia while a small part was assigned to Slovenia. This arrangement is even better for Slovenia (speaking from a land/water access perspective) as it gained a little bit of land and direct coast line. Since Yugoslavia is together it isn’t an issue that Slovenia has no coastline with international waters access as Slovenians can still go to Croatian Istria and Dalmatia. (Worth noting after WW2 Yugoslavia targeted ethnic Italians)

3. Yugoslavia breaks up and now it’s a problem Slovenia is only left with the coastline it was assigned after WW2: there is no international waters access as it’s blocked by Croatia and Italy (only needed a few more kilometers of Istria to have international waters access). So looking back Slovenia got screwed as it lost Trieste and international waters access.

Made edits to reflect that Istria and Dalmatia had a lot of Italians but weren’t majority Italian, also Trieste city limits wasn’t majority Slovenian either. Also made edits to reflect Slovenes and other Yugoslavic peoples living in Istria and Trieste were targeted by Facist Italy and after WW2 ethnic Italians were targeted by Yugoslavia.|Time to repost this on r/Slovenia.|Is okay because they have Luka Doncic|Technicaly we have access to international waters, but a good meme nonetheless|Slovenia actually does have access to international waters.",HistoryMemes,1i3oubg

Jokes aside, it is not surprising Stalin used WW2 to murder even more ethnic groups in Russia, like Volga Germans and Crimean Tatars*

*Even more insulting he accused this group of siding with the nazis in spite of the massive casualties it suffered resisting them.|The Cossacks, an ethnic group from southern Russia and Ukraine, faced severe repression by the Bolsheviks after the Russian Civil War due to their support for the White Russians. Between 1920 and 1939, many were deported and sent to Gulags. When Nazi Germany invaded in 1941, many Cossacks allied with the Axis, forming battalions to fight against the Red Army in Ukraine, while thousands more fled to Western countries like Austria and Yugoslavia.

After Germany's defeat in WWII, the Soviets demanded the repatriation of these Cossacks, accusing them of crimes against humanity. The Allies, knowing that  Soviet-held Allied POWs, had little choice but to comply with these demands.

In a notable incident in Lienz, Austria, British forces attempted to load thousands of Cossacks onto cattle trains for repatriation back to the Soviet Union. The Cossacks resisted, leading to a violent response where the British used batons, bayonets, and eventually firearms.

This resulted in an estimated 700 deaths, including women and children.

Similar events occured all over Europe, France had 240,000 soviets citizens on their own soils and were also force to repatriate them to the Soviet Union, were the majority (estimated 80%) would face trials for either treasons or crimes against humanity.

That doesn't mean it wasn't evil. Even people at the time were horrified by the massacres. There are, after all, many records of people, including church officials like local bishops, actively hiding the Jews.

Why did it make sense? The First Crusade was launched in an atmosphere of Christendom under siege. We often forget that the impetus for it was the Byzantine catastrophe at the Battle of Manzikert at the hands of the Turks, which resulted in the loss of the entirety of Syria and Asia Minor. On top of that, much of the Middle East descended into anarchy, making any pilgrimage unsafe. Both Byzantine officials asking for aid and returning pilgrims emphasized how Christians were now facing persecution and how Christian lands had fallen into the hands of infidels.

From the perspective of the average peasant or noble in Western Europe, who often had little nonviolent direct contact with Muslims (the bulk of actual cultural exchange happened later in Sicily and Spain), the difference between Muslims and Jews was often blurred, if acknowledged at all. Especially since Muslims practiced plenty of customs similarly to Jews, including those most glaring to medieval Christians, like circumcision or refusal to eat pork. Obviously, this wasn’t because they were stupid—it was because there was little interaction between European Christians and Muslims at the time. The Mediterranean and Spain were war zones where both sides fought to the death rather than tried to understand each other.

Now imagine the news spreading about the calamity in the East. As was common in the time before modern post and press, the news must have been exaggerated. Then came the call to defend Christendom, sparking an explosion of religious fervor and zealotry. Since the distinction between the faraway Muslim oppressors and the local Jewish communities was blurred, Jews, as a visible and often isolated minority, became scapegoats for the suffering and losses of Christendom. Especially enticing for people who had no means to travel to faraway Byzantium.|No matter what the question was, medieval Europe always found the answer to be kill the jews|It’s a bird!

The other given dates are 26 and 30 January. He was struck over his head by the Kharijite dissident Ibn Muljam with a poison-coated sword, in revenge for their defeat in the Battle of Nahrawan. Ali died from his wounds about two days later, aged sixty-two or sixty-three. By some accounts, he had long known about his fate by premonition or through Muhammad. Before his death, Ali requested either a meticulous application of lex talionis to Ibn Muljam or his pardon. At any rate, Ibn Muljam was later executed by Hasan, the eldest son of Ali. Fearing that his body might be exhumed and profaned by his enemies, Ali's burial place was kept a secret and remains uncertain. Several sites are mentioned as containing Ali's remains, including the shrine of Ali in Najaf and the shrine of Ali in Mazar.  The former site was identified during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809) and the town of Najaf developed around it, which has become a major destination for Shia pilgrimage|I was raised as a Muslim and they told me that one of the signs of the apocalypse would be war and massive division between muslims.

Another sad thing about his martyrdom is when he was attacked, Imam Al Hassan AS and Imam Al Hussain AS brought a doctor who said that Imam Ali AS could be fixed by milk. So, after the orphans of Kufa heard that Imam Ali's AS injuries could be fixed by milk, all of them gathered milk in bowls and went to the house of Imam Ali AS to save their father, because Imam Ali AS used to say to the orphans that if someone asks who is your father, you reply with my father is Ali.

This did not sit well with the Flemish and kicked of the conflict, which in Flemish sources if more often described as a revolt or rebellion.

The 11th of July 1302 is an important day for Flemish nationalists, that day the County of Flanders won the Battle of the Golden Spurs (also named the Battle of Courtrai) against the Kingdom of France in the Franco-Flemish War. For that reason it is also the official holiday of the Flemish Community.

What's funny is that of the 5 battles of the war, 3 were won by the French, and two by the County of Flanders. But the other Flemish victory, the 1303 Battle of Arques, was only a victory in that they most likely had way more troops and were able to defend their positions, even when sustaining heavy losses compared to the French.

Therefore every battle other than Courtrai was directly a loss or a win but with heavy losses. Flemish Nationalists tend to point to that as defining part of their history but nothing surrounding it. In Flanders (or atleast for me), I was barely taught in school about anything other than this battle in the entire war, despite it also being important but in a less positive way. Education is managed at a regional level here.

Eventually, the Flemish didn't even end up winning the war, having to cede cities such as Lille and Douai to France and paying huge sums of money in the Treaty of Athis-Sur-Orge.

> The historical documentation may be a a bit shaky, but what does factual accuracy matter when it comes to true passion? The story goes back to the 13th century, when two teenagers, Juan Diego Martinez de Marcilla and Isabel de Segura, met and fell in love.  Although they were both from noble families, Diego had no money and Isabel’s father refused to agree to the match. Her suitor asked to be granted five years to seek his fortune and prove himself worthy of her.

> When the five years were up, he returned to Teruel a wealthy man, only to find that his beloved Isabel had been forced to marry a rich man from nearby Albarracin just the day before! He went to see her in secret and begged for a kiss. As a married woman, she was honour-bound to refuse. The distraught Diego dropped dead on the spot.

https://mazgeenlegendary.wordpress.com/the-lovers-of-teruel/
> ... Diego explained about the letters he had written and why he had arrived late, and she told him that the letters had been kept from her and how her father had told her that Diego was dead and insisted that she marry as soon as the five-year period had ended.

> “I accept that it is God’s will that we not be united in this life,” Diego said, “but at least give me a kiss or I will die.”

> “I wish that things were otherwise, my love. I understand your grief and pain because I feel the same emotions. But now that I am married, I no longer belong to myself, and I cannot give to you what belongs to my husband, not even a kiss.”

> For the love he had for her, Diego would not force her to do what she felt was improper. He turned to leave, stopped suddenly, and fell dead to the floor. Isabel threw herself onto his body and wept so loudly that Rodrigo woke up, asking what was wrong.

> Isabel went to him before he could see Diego’s corpse and related the events of her and Diego’s relationship, only changing the names.

> “I dreamed that a young friend of mine had agreed to marry her lover …” she began, and when she reached the present “… he arrived too late to prevent the marriage. He asked her to at least give him a kiss so that he would not die of grief, but she refused because she felt it would not be right, and then he died. That’s why I was crying. Tell me, do you think she did the right thing?”

> Rodrigo laughed and said, “She was very silly and prudish and overly cruel to one she loved, not to give him one kiss when he was alive to save his life, when she would kiss him a thousand times in her mind after he died.”

> She then showed him Diego’s body, saying, “I am that silly and prudish woman, but I have kept my honour.”

> When Rodrigo recovered from his astonishment, they discussed what they should do. They realised that it would be legally awkward and socially scandalous for the body to be found in the bedroom, and Diego’s family might want revenge, so they decided to take the corpse out and leave it in the doorway of Diego’s family’s house.|The what?|🎶 ***Los amantes de Teruel, tonta ella, tonto él*** 🎶

None of us remember what we did as children – we think we do, but we don’t remember it as it really happened. Intuitively, the Losers knew they had to be together again. The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood. It’s another version of the glass tunnel that connects the children’s library and the adult library. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now more sensitivity to those issues.”

“That sounds like my statement. To it I’d just add that it’s fascinating to me that there has been so much comment about that single sex scene and so little about the multiple child murders.

\> The Pinkerton agents attempted to disembark, and more shots were fired. Conflicting testimony exists as to which side fired the first shot in this encounter. (Shooting having begun earlier when the barges were being towed up the river) John T. McCurry, a boatman on the steamboat Little Bill (which had been hired by the Pinkerton Detective Agency to ferry its agents to the steel mill) and one of the men wounded by the strikers, said: ""The armed Pinkerton men commenced to climb up the banks. Then the workmen opened fire on the detectives. The men shot first, and not until three of the Pinkerton men had fallen did they respond to the fire. I am willing to take an oath that the workmen fired first, and that the Pinkerton men did not shoot until some of their number had been wounded."" But according to The New York Times, the Pinkertons shot first. The newspaper reported that the Pinkertons opened fire and wounded William Foy, a worker. Regardless of which side opened fire first, the first two individuals wounded were Frederick Heinde, captain of the Pinkertons, and Foy. The Pinkerton agents aboard the barges then fired into the crowd, killing two and wounding eleven. The crowd responded in kind, killing two and wounding twelve.

554,Liberia Has an Uncomfortable History,https://i.redd.it/dw6op7xjo5de1.jpeg,52,2025-01-15 18:31:48,7,"In the 1990s, Liberia was engulfed in one of Africa’s most devastating civil wars. Over a decade, more than 200,000 people were killed or mutilated, and half the country’s population became refugees. Among the atrocities, five American nuns were murdered, epitomizing the war’s horrors.

Orchestrating the chaos was warlord Charles Taylor, who sought to seize power and wealth. A pivotal moment came in 1991 when Taylor struck a deal with Firestone, the American rubber giant operating Liberia’s largest rubber plantation. Firestone had been in Liberia since 1926, but it wasn’t until Taylor’s rebel forces gained control of large parts of the country that the company became essential to his plans.

In exchange for protection, Firestone provided Taylor’s forces with over $2.3 million in cash(adjusted for inflation), food, and supplies. Taylor used the company’s plantation as a base, storing weapons and broadcasting propaganda. This relationship gave Taylor the legitimacy and resources he needed to solidify his grip on power.

Taylor later admitted that Firestone’s support was critical to his early regime. For Firestone, cooperating with Taylor was a difficult decision made under threat, but critics argue the company played a role in enabling his war crimes.

By 1997, after years of violence, Taylor was elected president. His rule brought no lasting peace, and he was eventually forced out in 2003. Later, he was convicted of war crimes in Sierra Leone and sentenced to 50 years in prison.

Firestone’s involvement remains a controversial chapter in Liberia’s history. While the company claims it acted under duress to protect its workers, others believe it prioritized profit over ethics|At Taylor's trial, he was found to be aiding and abetting some of the most heinous crimes in recorded human history|You learn more here

Georges Boudarel was a Frenchman who started as a Marxist and Stalinist philosophy teacher before joining the Vietminh during the Indochina War. There, he became a political commissar in prisoner camps, notably Camp 113. His role was to ""reeducate"" captured French soldiers through propaganda and ideological lessons. After the war, he disappeared into the Soviet bloc but returned to France in 1966, benefiting from an amnesty law despite having been sentenced to death in absentia.

Camp 113: A living hell

Camp 113, where Boudarel served, became a symbol of the Vietminh prison camps. Prisoners endured horrific conditions: famine, disease, and a constant struggle to survive. But survival wasn’t just physical—captured soldiers faced intense psychological pressure through political reeducation sessions designed to convert them to the communist cause. For many, the memories of this camp remain an open wound, highlighting that this war wasn’t only fought on the battlefield but also in the minds of those involved.

Who accused him and why?

On February 13, 1991, during a Senate conference, Jean-Jacques Beucler, a former Vietminh prisoner, identified Georges Boudarel as the political commissar of Camp 113. He accused him of orchestrating reeducation sessions where French prisoners were forced to accuse themselves of crimes against the state.
On April 3, 1991, a complaint for crimes against humanity was filed against Boudarel by attorney Jean-Marc Varaut on behalf of former sergeant Władysław Sobański and the National Association of Former Indochina Prisoners (ANAPI). However, in March 1991, a group of about forty academics, including Pierre Vidal-Naquet and Laurent Schwartz, came to Boudarel's defense.
The case was ultimately dismissed by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the 1966 amnesty law also applied to international crimes.

The Boudarel Affair II
In May 1993, Georges Boudarel reignited the controversy by maintaining a defamation complaint, despite the Court of Cassation’s decision to drop charges against him. Judge Jean-Pierre Getti reopened the case, sparking further debate over the definition of crimes against humanity. The case ended in 1996 with a dismissal.
Władysław Sobański, a former prisoner of Camp 113, responded by filing a direct lawsuit against Boudarel for malicious accusation. However, the Paris Court of Appeal rejected this claim in 1998, a decision upheld by the Court of Cassation in 1999, which ruled that the 1966 amnesty law also nullified such actions.

Weakened by years of controversy, isolated, and ill, Georges Boudarel passed away on December 26, 2003, in Les Lilas (Seine-Saint-Denis).

Note on the 1966 amnesty law
Introduced under Charles de Gaulle, the 1966 amnesty law aimed to ease tensions following colonial conflicts. It annulled certain convictions, allowing controversial figures like Georges Boudarel to return to France without facing prosecution. While intended as a gesture of reconciliation, the law sparked debates over justice and collective memory.",HistoryMemes,1i1tc0i

A large reason why the KMT was so unsuccessful against the Japanese and why the CCP was so successful was that the CCP were actually fighting the Japanese while the KMT were not. Chiang Kai Chek saw the CCP as a bigger threat to his fascist dictatorship than the Japanese because he was absolutely hyperfocussed on a politically unified China. Just to illustrate this point:

1) Chiang Kai Chek’s officers were so fed up with him focussing on communists instead of the invading Japanese that his officers orchestrated for him to be captured by a rival warlord and be saved by the CCP so that he would be forced to negotiate a cooperation treaty with the CCP to fight Japan.

2) when the U.S. began supplying supplying the KMT to fight China, Chiang Kai Chek sat on those supplies until enough were built up for a huge offensive against the CCP… after the Japanese took Nanking. The capital of the ROC at the time. His reaction to being forcibly removed from his own capital by the Japanese was to attack his temporary allies.

Yes the CCP ended up being an extremely bad for the Chinese people after 1955, but these points above are a large part of the reason why almost everyone on mainland China sided with the CCP post-WW2.|One nitpick is the Second United Front was actually signed in 1936 shortly before the war with Japan, and is one of the reasons the Kuomintang was willing to resist them in 1937.

With an estimate of 200,000 – 300,000 converts including several powerful figures and daimyos, Christianity had become a major player in Japanese politics. This was due to Portugal’s exclusive trade and missionary work in Japan, the only European country the Japanese had a relationship with. This would all change with the arrival of Dutch traders in the early 17^(th) century, which would stoke religious rivalries between the Catholic Portuguese and the Protestant Dutch. Attempting to wrest control from the Catholic monopoly on trade with Japan, the Dutch warned the Japanese shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, that Spain and Portugal was planning to conquer the island nation. The Dutch instead promised to limit themselves to trading, and would not do any missionary work. Eventually, this led to the expulsion of Catholic missionaries, the Dutch becoming the only European trading partner of Japan for hundreds of years, and an outright ban on Christianity in Japan.

De Witt was elected Grand Pensionary of Holland, and together with his uncle Cornelis de Graeff, he controlled the Dutch political system from around 1650 until the Rampjaar (Disaster Year) of 1672. This progressive cooperation between the two statesmen, and the consequent support of Amsterdam under the rule of De Graeff, was an important political axis that organized the political system within the republic.

As a leading republican of the Dutch States Party, De Witt opposed the House of Orange-Nassau and the Orangists and preferred a shift of power from the central government to the regenten. However, the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar, due to an alliance of England, France and several German states which planned on invading the Dutch Republic.

They also did this during the Javanese Civil War, where they partitioned the Mataram Sultanate into Yogyakarta and Surakarta in 1755). 

3. VOC uses local ships to burn down spice plantations and villages that grow them in the Moluccas (Indonesians call it 'Pelayaran Hongi').  This was done to prevent other European powers from trading with natives and to keep prices high. 

4. VOC's first governor general, Jaan Pieterszoon Coen burned down the wealthy Port Town of Jayakarta / Sunda Kelapa to build his base of operation, Batavia.

While the UK soldier gets Clement Attlee (the man who oversaw the introduction of the National Health Service to a post-blitz UK), and the Australian soldier gets Robert Menzies (the man who oversaw a revamp of the Australian education system), the South African soldier was unfortunately less lucky, and got a literal fascist as his leader. 

In the 1948 elections, D.F Malan and his National Party ran on a policy of introducing Apartheid to South Africa, against the Boer War and both World Wars hero, Jan Smuts, and his United Party (Smuts had actually become opposed to white supremacism in the last few years of his life, and he had released the Fagan Commission documents during his rule, which were documents that argued against the introduction of Apartheid.)

Jan Smuts and the United Party won the popular vote in the 1948 elections, but lost the election to the National Party, as the latter had gained more seats through malapportionment. As a result, D.F Malan became the new prime minister of South Africa, and was able to introduce Apartheid and totalitarianism to South Africa. 

Obviously, most South African WW2 veterans were not up for a fascist ruling the country they just fought fascism for. As such, the Torch Commando was formed. The Torch Commando was an organisation founded in the 1950s as a response to the National Party attempting to remove coloured South Africans from the voter rolls within the Cape Province.

Led by RAF Battle of Britain Ace, Adolph ‘Sailor’ Malan, The Commando’s membership was primarily made up of South African military veterans from World War 2, World War 1, and the Second Boer War. These wars all in some way or another were fought by South Africans in response to Imperialism and tyranny, and the Torch’s fight against Apartheid was no different. The Torch Commando was open to all races, and had an explicitly anti fascist ideology.

The Commando did everything within its power to rally support against the National Party, and to a certain extent, it succeeded greatly. The Commando did leaflet raids, they crashed pro-fascist rallies, they did massive torchlight protests, and they legally fought the National Party wherever they could. The National Party, however, was concerned with the Commando’s growing numbers, and soon banned government workers (including soldiers) from joining or being in the Torch. This ultimately led to the Torch’s collapse, but for many members, their fight against fascism was not over.

Torch Commando members such as Joe Slovo, Harry Schwarz, and Colin Eglin all became leading figures within the anti apartheid movement, and this can partially be attributed to the Torch Commando’s kindling of such beliefs. While the National Party successfully extinguished the Torch’s flame, the embers that remained would go on to ignite new struggles against fascism within South Africa.|Apartheid first became a major idea during the war, when much of the Afrikaner elite threw their political lot with Nazi Germany|Menzies can suck a fat one.|It was less an example of Fascism and more a generically authoritarian right-wing state with Fascist tendencies, such as a mythologized and idealized historical narrative and an ultra-militarized system dedicated to preserving Afrikanerdom. In essence, it resembled a militaristic ethno-state.  

I personally believe this population, in many ways, mirrors the experiences of Black Americans, and their plight was perhaps an inevitable outcome of these dynamics. The British effectively reshaped the societal perception of Coloureds, preventing an even more prolonged history of servitude and torment. Without such intervention, it is plausible that this group would have been subjected to such extreme adversity that they might have been forced to forge an even more distinct culture as a result of their suffering.  

The Native Bantu population, meanwhile, would likely have still faced similar systemic marginalization, potentially being confined to reservations. However, they might not have been subjected to arbitrary forced removals. That said, it is also conceivable that Anglo settlers could have developed attitudes toward the Boers similar to how Cajuns were treated in the United States. However, unlike the Cajuns, the Boers would likely have remained resistant to racial inclusivity—at least until the 1990s.  

A more diverse immigration policy, akin to those of the United States or Australia, could have drastically altered this trajectory. However, such a policy might have also provoked a reactionary backlash among the Afrikaners. Based on my experiences living among and studying the Afrikaner community, it is clear that they harbor strong opinions about various groups. For instance, they have expressed dissatisfaction with the perceived smugness of the German population. One could reasonably infer that the arrival of Irish, Scandinavian, Italian, Polish, English, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Turkish, and Jewish immigrants—particularly the English—would have elicited significant discontent.  

Hypothetically, it would be intriguing to observe how Afrikaners might have responded to the development of a uniquely Anglo architectural style, blending elements of American and local designs. This could serve as a cultural experiment to gauge their adaptability or resistance. To clarify, I am not advocating for Anglo-supremacy; rather, I am speculating about factors that might have unsettled the Afrikaner community.  

In addition, the establishment of distinct territorial rights for the Bantu in the northern regions of the country could have provoked resistance. A violent reaction to such measures could have been met with an equally resolute response, mirroring the Afrikaner approach to perceived threats—one of uncompromising force until surrender was ensured.  

Integration of the Coloured population into educational institutions and public service would have been another crucial step. Any interference in such efforts should have been met with firm legal action. While this approach may seem authoritarian, it might have been necessary to lay the groundwork for a more inclusive society.  

Ultimately, I envision that, with proper management, the region could have evolved into something akin to a melting pot akin to the United States—albeit influenced by Afrikaner culture. The Afrikaners already borrowed heavily from the aesthetics and cultural norms of White Americans, particularly those in the Southern United States, for reasons that are quite evident. However, fostering the broader liberal ideals and cultural diversity of the American model could have led to a more harmonious and progressive society.  

This is, of course, a speculative reflection. Greater efforts to balance Afrikaner interests with those of other groups, coupled with unbiased historical education and more open immigration policies, might have created a different, perhaps more equitable, trajectory for the region.|""Battle for North Africa""

However, after the admiral's death expeditions were stopped and the fleet was eventually disbanded, just as Europe was ushering the age of exploration and colonialism.|There was a frankly simple reason. The Ming were busy battling the steppe nomads along the Great wall during this time, and basically the imperial court decided funds for the army fighting the nomads was of bigger importance than funds for the navy which had little need owing to much Chinese shipping flowing through the grand canal instead of the coadtal sea|I've seen some theories about how the Mongol conquest and Yuan rule caused some sort of cultural PTSD for China, which is why the Ming was a lot more conservative than the pre-Yuan dynasties (Tang, Song etc.).  

Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Ming emperor, wanted to return to what he viewed as the ""good old days of pre-Yuan China"", reverting back to an agrarian state based on traditional values. He didn't trust the merchants and the wealthy as a whole, and thus made laws that would restrict commercial activity, like how people weren't allowed to travel about anywhere over 50 KM from their hometown without permits. 

And since the first emperor's policies tend to be viewed as the foundation of the dynasty (sort of like a constitution), these policies continued to affect later emperors and bureaucrats.|This really takes the Treasure Fleet out of context.

For one thing: it wasn't meant to be an exploration/colonization fleet. In the early 1400s the Ming's Yongle Emperor was having problems with Central Asian Empires (notably Timur's) and at this point the Silk Road was becoming shit and unstable. The Chinese then began thinking of rerouting their foreign trade through the sea but they had a problem: they weren't as well known for sea trade as they were via the old land routes. So to send a message that China was now open for business by sea the Ming sent Zheng He and a huge Treasure Fleet with its main mission: to dazzle every single locale they visit with the Ming Dynasty's wealth and power that they'd make Tributaries and/or Trade Partners in every single port & country they visited. So they built like 8 pleasure barges loaded with as much glam it could carry, had it escorted by naval fleets, and sent it to the Indian Ocean. 

For *Seven* voyages Zheng He's party cruise did exactly that: rizzed up states along the Indian Ocean into being business partners and allies. And while yes it participated in wars (such as on behalf of their Sri Lankan allies) and did some exploring (was tasked to go beyond the Arabian peninsula to see what the hell lay south of Ethiopia, a region the Chinese did not know), colonization and exploration wasnt the point.

By 1430s with its mission pretty much accomplished and under a new Emperor, Zheng's cruises were becoming frightfully expensive. With the resurgent threat of the Mongols in the North the Ming State could not afford to send state-sponsored booze cruises anymore, and thus the Treasure Voyages got mothballed. 

Tldr. Yes it did suck by the end, actually.|Two things:

1. Zheng He's treasure fleets were actually draining the treasury. They were basically elaborate PR tours.

2.

There was no incentive to colonize and in fact a secondary mission of the expeditions was to basically force the Chinese diaspora to go home. Independent merchants like what existed in Europe were clamped down on rather than made partners. It’s why capitalism and industrialization happened in the west rather than China. China being a centralized bureaucratic empire meant there could be no constant innovation for the sake of production and warfare since there was no reason to do so. The things they did invent were for enhancing the bureaucracy (like paper) or for innovations sake like what the Taoists were up to. There could be no Chinese colonialism because the economic drivers and state institutions just didn’t exist to incentivize it and rather actively stifled it.|The massive treasure ships are garbage made up to promote modern day Chinese expansion.  If such a ship existed it would have been larger than any wooden ship in history, even 5 or 6 master schooners that were made in the 1900s but they were allegedly made before Columbus.

The battle itself was fought by New Zealanders of the 6th Brigade and Australians of the 19th, under Generals Vasey and Barrowclough. 

The defenders set up positions in the Thermopylae coastal pass, one of the few passages to the Greek capital of Athens which the Germans would have to cross.

>Manchmal wirft sich beim Lesen die Frage auf, ob nicht zu vorschnell von der Repräsentation auf die historische  Wirklichkeit  geschlossen  wird,  etwa  wenn  der  gerichtliche  Zweikampf  zwischen Mann und Frau als historisch verbürgt dargestellt wird, obwohl der Verfasser selbst  feststellt,  dass  „lediglich  ein  einziger  Kampf  historisch  nach\[zu\]weisen“  sei(S. 55) und es sich dabei um eine chronikalische Darstellung handelt, die in über 250-jährigem Abstand zum beschriebenen Ereignis steht. Ansonsten sind im Wesentlichen literarische und vor allem normative Darstellungen (Rechtsbücher) bekannt, die  auch  noch  hoch  intertextuell  verquickt  sind.  Aber  natürlich  kann  auch  die Nichtexistenz solcher Zweikämpfe schwerlich bewiesen werden.

A Deepl translation:

>Reading the book sometimes raises the question of whether it is not too hasty to draw conclusions about historical reality from the representation, for example when the judicial duel between man and woman is presented as historically authenticated, although the author himself states that ‘only a single fight is historically verifiable’ (p. 55) and that this is a chronicle that is more than 250 years removed from the event described.

 The fruits of their efforts were enjoyed by weak men, whose degeneracy brought  back dark times. 

The empire was now at the mercy of evil and chaos, enemies within and abroad tearing it apart.

 And in these darkest of times, the greatest of all men arose, to fulfill the legend of prophecy. 

In Illyria, a sun priestess of the Aurelianus clan gave birth to a divine son, Aurelian.

 At the start of the crisis, he enlisted on the legions to serve Rome when she needed him most.

 Battle after battel he defeated Rome's enemies, with talent and skill never seen before. 

Emperor after emperor he served, killing barbarians and traitors alike, always loyal and victorious.

 With tears in his eyes, Claudius begged Aurelian to save Rome as it's emperor, trough his last breath. 

For God and empire he put on the mask, marching on Italy and deposing the usurper Quintillius.

 When the Vandals dared to invade his home, he marched back and slaughtered every last one of them. 

And as the Germs dared to invade Italy itself, he crushed their hordes against the ocean, denying any mercy. 

Once in Rome, he restored the economy from decadence, cleansing the city of all corrupt senators. 

To make Rome eternal, he ordered built the Aurelian Walls, so it would stand a thousand years more. 

After decades of terrorizing the Danube, Aurelian crushed the Goths, delivering justice to Cniva. 

For the empire's sake, he evacuated the citizens of Dacia, strengthening the Danube against invasion.

Sailing east, Aurelian gathered his cavalrymen and slaughtered Zenobia's army, making her flee away.

Palmyra was then destroyed for all time, and Zenobia captured before fleeing to the Sassanids.

Punished by Sol, Shapur was banished from this mortal realm, and Valerian's remains recovered.

Returning west, he defeated Tetricus' legions of traitors, making him bow again to the light of Rome.

Restoring the empire from the brink of collapse, Aurelian was acclaimed RESTITVTOR ORBIS, the Restorer of the World.

In his triumph, he had Zenobia judged guilty, having her executed and lifting Dido's curse forever.

Ruling alongside his wife he eradicated degeneracy from the streets, restoring law and order to Rome.

Bringing peace, freedom, justice and security to his empire, he began rebuilding it from the ashes.

As the hero of prophecy, Aurelian was the only emperor to be luckier than Augustus, and better than Trajan.

To establish an eternity of order, Aurelian served as a model to the best men of the next generation.

In only five glorious years, Aurelian had made Rome one empire, with one emperor, under one God!

Setting sail for the east, Aurelian engaged in one final campaign, seeking to destroy all of Rome's enemies.

But just as his unrivaled accomplishments made him a hero, so did it fill others with envy and resentment.

As Aurelian built an world of good and order, their evil and chaos grew more and more threatened.

Through lies they convinced themselves, a perfect man could not be allowed to exist.

In the darkest of nights, the Praetorians gave in to their evil, and committed their worst crime.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The thread of prophecy,

is severed.

is doomed.""

He found this work so enjoyable that he pivoted from being a part-time doctor and part-time Evangelist to a full-time doctor.
On the 4th of November 1835, he founded the Canton Pok Tsai Hospital, the first Western-style hospital in China.

While the hospital was originally only intended to treat eye diseases, it became so successful that it became impractical to focus only on eyes, and thus the hospital began to treat all diseases. In 1866, the first Western-style medical school was established in the hospital.

Over his twenty years in China, Parker treated over 50,000 patients. The hospital was where Sun Yat-sen, first president of the Republic of China, studied medicine, and it still exists today as the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Sun Yat-sen University.

After Admiral Horatio Nelson was killed during the Battle of Trafalgar- his most famous victory- his body was brought back to England for burial. To keep it preserved in the ship, it was placed in a barrel full of alcohol. 

According to a popular legend, when they finally opened the barrel to remove Nelson's body, they found it to be almost entirely dry- sailors has drilled small holes in the barrel to siphon out the liquor. The practice became known as ""Tapping the Admiral,"" and the term is sometimes still used by drinkers.|Nelson was initially preserved in brandy, but this failed to prevent decay.  Not only was the cask containing his body under armed guard, but anybody who tried to drink it would have been horribly sickened or killed.

During a provisioning stop the fluid was changed to ""spirit of wine"" (pure alcohol) which worked somewhat better but the body was already pretty far gone.

For example in the mid 1990s they lost to the de facto independent Chechenia and had to sign a peace treaty in 1997. 2 years later Vladimir Putin restarted the war  after some dubious ""terrorist attacks"" and it took 7 years to fully subdue the Chechens and place a quisling regime led by Ramzan Kadyrov in charge. Around 20% of the population was killed by Russians and local collaborators in the war.|The Soviet Union was not just Russia|Are we forgetting the absolute string of beat downs the Russian Empire put on the Ottomans?  If anything Russia can push its smaller or weaker  neighbors around, but face a lot of trouble when going up against western powers.|It was all Zhukov and manpower|Small state = second largest country in europe after Russia itself|Kind of depends, really.

It managed to do well against the Georgians in 2008 even with its logistical and equipment problems, mostly because the Georgians had utterly flubbed the defense. They had an army created for counterinsurgency against the breakaway states, not for fighting a large, regular army, and Russia's attack was so sudden there really was no time to react. By the time anyone knew what was going on, the Russians were halfway to Tbilisi. Then again, that was a Georgian weakness, not a Russian strength.

The Crimean War was an old, antiquated army of conscripted serfs resting on its laurels for beating Napoleon over four decades ago. Even the various Anglo-French blunders couldn't save the Russians from their own incompetence and poor army quality. It helps that the alliance wasn't interested in conquering the Russian heartland; they just wanted to humiliate Russia by taking its biggest (and really, only) warm water port, which they did pretty well.

Afghanistan... was never really going to be tamed. The Soviets were deeply unpopular for invading, the infrastructure was poor even before the invasion wrecked it (which meant the Soviet army couldn't really spread its control beyond the cities), and the West was just pouring money in by the billions of dollars to keep the insurgency going. As was demonstrated by Vietnam and even Afghanistan itself later, you can't really beat a determined insurgency; you can conquer a country, but you sure as hell couldn't ***hold*** it.

Even the times when the Russians ""win"" against major armies, they're almost always invading. And every time, some genius decides to go for Moscow, at the end of a long, overstretched and overworked logistical train, which leaves the Russians plenty of time to go scorched earth to deny the enemy supply. And the poor saps have either the bad luck to find themselves in the worst winter in a long while, or their invasion dragged out so they face the brunt of winter anyways.

The Germans in 1917 had a better time because a) Russia was still in a mess because the army's morale had cratered, plus they were still in a critical point because of the recent October Revolution, and b) the geniuses of the new Communist government decided to not fight the Germans! They figured the Germans would just get bored or demoralized and leave because the Bolsheviks wouldn't make a deal. So they invaded a lot of Russia, without the Bolsheviks being able to enact scorched earth, thus giving them a much better position than Napoleon, Charles XII or Hitler ever had.

The Mongols were the ***Mongols***. A cold Russian winter is a light spring breeze compared to the ice-cold steppes of Mongolia, plus they had an incredibly strong logistical system for a nomadic army, one of the best in the world.

Really, it's less ""Russians are tough on their own turf"" and more ""they're used to their territory and know how to plan around it"" and ""they can just trade space for time and bleed you out"". Plus, let's be honest, even Russians can be good when forced against a wall.|The lend lease program might have something to do with this.|More like ""Russia when fighting by itself"" vs ""Russia when it's allied with the world's biggest naval and economic power(s)""|Fighting Ukrainians vs Fighting with Ukrainians.|I think the German army was the best in europe in the first world war, a lot less people than the brits, french and russians (and later italy) conbined yet defeated 1 of those nations while also possibly winning the first world war on the western front. It was certainly much more possible than winning ww2. Very advanced weaponary if you dont count their tanks. Think about it, great artillery tactics, machine guns, advanced trenches, advanced earoplanes, good generals. 

And those defeated the russian army by a landslide. Given the Russian army was very bad with no modernization, but the point still stands|For one Ukraine had the assistance of major U.N. countries in one form or another. |In Afghanistan, they set a troop ceiling in order to reduce costs (monetary) and perhaps casualties. iirc, this was set at 120,000 or so. It should be noted that the US was saying it would have taken 200k soldiers with then modern technology to even attempt to properly secure Afghanistan. The Soviet forces also generally had poor morale and equipment, and while some did see the need for tactics and some were developed, anything beyond the basics wasn't often used. 

They also used a lot of Afghan forces, even though many would simply get well fed and trained and then vanish on their first mission with their new Soviet equipment. Sometimes they'd go home, but sometimes they would join some Muj or bandits and fight the Soviets.

Later in Chechnya, they also tried limited force numbers and heavy firepower. Tactically they didn't seem very adroit and kept making the same mistakes over and over. Their logistics system was apparently even worse. What few reports were coming out talked about the poor conditions of the Russian troops from equipment to even food. 

As for WWII and such, it wasn't too different except for capping troop numbers. It was often a matter of relative mass attacks or holding ground at great cost, but since it was against invaders, they tended to be quite stubborn.|Defending is easier.

Stories of him arriving into a camp and half a dozen men hanging before lunch.|Loyalists were frequently subjected to public shaming. One notorious punishment was being tarred and feathered, where hot tar was poured on a person's body and covered with feathers, causing extreme pain and humiliation. Effigies of Loyalists were burned, and their homes were vandalized or destroyed to intimidate them into silence or force them to flee. Loyalists were often forced to sign oaths of allegiance to the Patriot cause under threat of violence. Patriot governments and militias often seized Loyalist property and redistributed it. Laws such as Confiscation Acts allowed Patriot authorities to legally take the land and wealth of Loyalists, leaving many destitute. In states like New York, South Carolina, and Virginia, large Loyalist estates were confiscated and sold to support the Patriot war effort. In some regions, Loyalists were beaten, tortured, or even killed.

Mobs and Patriot militias sometimes acted without legal authority, engaging in extrajudicial punishment against suspected Loyalists. In the Southern colonies, partisan warfare often involved brutal attacks between Loyalist and Patriot militias, blurring the line between civil war and revolution.  Loyalists were often denied legal protections and barred from holding public office. Laws in several colonies outlawed Loyalist speech and banned Loyalists from voting or participating in government. Some colonies issued bills of attainder, declaring Loyalists guilty of treason without trial. Loyalists and their families were socially isolated, facing boycotts and exclusion from community activities. Churches and social groups often expelled members suspected of Loyalist sympathies. Interpersonal conflicts over politics fractured communities and families.

After the war, Loyalists were often unwelcome in the newly formed United States. Many fled to British Canada (especially Nova Scotia and Ontario) or to Britain, resulting in the displacement of around 60,000–80,000 Loyalists. Despite the Treaty of Paris (1783), which called for the U.S. to cease persecution of Loyalists and restore their confiscated property, these protections were largely ignored by state governments. Loyalist veterans and families were never fully compensated for their losses, though Britain offered land grants and pensions to some.

As one of the last surviving members of House Plantagenet after the Wars of the Roses, she and her brother Edward were seen as threats to the new Tudor dynasty since they had arguably better claims to the throne than the new king Henry VII. Because of this, Edward was imprisoned and then executed, while Margaret was married off to a Tudor cousin. Their lands and wealth were also seized.

Over the years, Margaret kept a low profile and did not cause trouble. Eventually, she came back into royal favor after Catherine of Aragon, whom she had served as a lady-in-waiting, married Henry VIII. She initially enjoyed a good relationship with the new monarch. He gave her a pension, restored some of her lands, and she even became the godmother to the new Princess Mary Tudor.



Things started to deteriorate for Margaret when Henry VIII decided to divorce Catherine for Anne Boleyn. She publicly opposed Henry VIII's decisions and even refused to return some royal jewelry in her possession. The situation worsened due to her son Reginald Pole, a staunch Catholic and cardinal, who helped organize Catholic resistance to Henry VIII. Reginald publicly broke with the king by calling him a tyrant and murderer, urging Catholic monarchs to invade England to overthrow him.

Another of Margaret's sons was arrested for plotting with Reginald. She was accused of helping him and was also arrested. All her lands and wealth were again taken from her, and she was condemned to execution. Margaret refused to lay her head on the chopping block, reportedly saying, ""So should traitors do, and I am none"". She told the executioner that if he wanted her head, he would have to take it.

Margaret had so much spite left in her that she curved a poem into her prison wall

""For traitors on the block should die;

I am no traitor, no, not I!

Harlan for his part had already turned cloak and was working for the King Dost Muhammad Khan. 

The Brits took Harlan’s apartments and office in the Bala Hisar and even took his horse.

Harlan left Afghanistan.

Later, the Brits were asked by the new king, Shah Shujah to leave the Bala Hisar and encamp outside the citadel.

Eventually, Dost Muhammad rose against the British driving them out and forcing a retreat to Jalalabad, harrying them all the way, resulting in 40,000 casualties and the entire army destroyed save for one lone Englishman. Assistant Surgeon William Brydon rode into Jalalabad on January 13 1849. As depicted in many paintings.

He was the only Englishman to do it, though 115 others survived by being ransomed as POWs.

And one sepoy was known to have done it:

One sepoy, Havildar Sita Ram, escaped from Afghanistan after 21 months of slavery and rejoined his former regiment at Delhi.

Roger I was a Norman invader who invaded Sicily in 1061 (which was under Muslim control) and would later fully conquer Sicily in 1091. Roger II inherited the throne from his late brother (who inherited it from their father), and like most Norman rulers he embraced multiculturalism. One of his finest churches; [Cappella Palatina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappella_Palatina), used architectural styles from both the Christian (Norman doors, Byzantine dome, mosaics) world and Muslim world (Fatmid arches, Ibernian Muqarnas).

The German entire Schlieffen plan was predicated on the fact that they could not win a prolonged war of attrition so it would be better to have a chance at quickly taking out France even if that meant Britain would also join the war and blockade Germany.

Germany hinged their entire plan to win on quickly knocking out France and was willing to risk Britan joining in to achieve that objective. The failure of this attempt meant that Germany was caught in a war they could not fight; a war of attrition. This became extra hard for them now becuase Britan was in the war due to them envading Belgium and could just use their navy to starve Germany into submission.|The Guns of August turns the Battle of the Marne into a nail biter with me, knowing how the battle turned out, sitting on the edge of my seat with absolutely no idea how the allies are going to stop the Germans from taking Paris.

After that, Germany was doomed to starve. But there are so few naval engagements, that it is easier for it to stand out compared to the many important land battles.|Hot take: it's not the miracle that people think it is. 


The German army was within sight of Paris, but it had lunged dangerously far forward in order to reach it. Already the fundamental rule of WW1 warfare was becoming apparent: it was extremely difficult, in an era of massed artillery bombardment without mechanization, for an attacker to resupply themselves once they had moved forward through roads and fields that their own shells had just torn up into muddy, pock-marked nightmares. Railways get torn up, bridges get blown, wagons and cars get stuck and horses starve for lack of grazing. The German advance had slowed because, contrary to all expectations prior to the war, it was actually kind of hard for a WWI-era army to overrun an entire country. 


By the time they reached the Marne, the foremost German army had advanced over a hundred kilometres from their railhead. They had lost sixty percent of their logistical transportation capacity. Its army had marched five hundred kilometres in a month, with an unexpectedly bloody fight through Belgium. Moltke had made the controversial decision to move a third of the force to other fronts, but honest it's not clear if that would have changed their situation. The Germans were scarecrows by the time they came close to Paris. They were overextended, exhausted, starving, and with gaps developing between the armies. 


As for the battle itself - the French obviously won and the German advance was turned back, but *both sides* lost a quarter of a million men. The Marne was an absolute bloodbath for everybody. It's difficult to even call it a victory. The most surprising thing was that the French didn't fall apart beforehand and the Germans didn't fall apart afterwards. How often do you kill half a million men in a little over a week? |On the first day of the Battle of the Somme over 10,000 documentaries were commissioned|I feel like the 11th battle of the Isonzo river is the most important battle of WW1|It's called a miracle dude.",HistoryMemes,1hya1k9

An American socialite named Ursula ventures into the jungle with her fiancé. George saves Ursula from a lion attack, and the two quickly form a bond. After Ursula's fiancé accidentally shoots George, Ursula takes George back to San Francisco. There, George experiences modern society for the first time. He sees a commercial advertising coffee in a romantic setting and decides that if he has coffee, then Ursula will fall for him. So he begins eating coffee grounds, resulting in over-the-top behavior, including this snippet.

Coffee originated in Ethiopia, and was eventually brought to Yemen. When it became popular in Europe, but the export of fertile coffee beans had been forbidden by Ottomans.

From the Song Dynasty (but likely much older) there was the story of Pan Zhang and Wang Zhongxian, a love story between a male writer and his student. The two are described as being like husband and wife, sharing the same pillow and coverlet with unbounded intimacy, when they died they were buried in the same grave on a holy mountain. There's also writing from the Liu Song dynasty noting that homosexual relationships were as common in the imperial court as heterosexual ones, as well as rural provinces having faux marriage customs for homosexual couples from as early as the Zhou dynasty. Multiple emperors had male concubines as well as female. Taoism even has a minor deity whose domain is homosexual sex (Tu Er Shen) originally worshipped in Fujian, the Qing banned the deity but there's now a temple to them in Taipei that's the only temple in the world dedicated to homosexual love. Emperor Wen of Chen tried to make his favourite male lover into a queen, but was unsuccessful and made him a general instead

It wasn't until the Jianjing Emperor of the Ming dynasty that homosexual intercourse was banned, but was poorly enforced until the Qing dynasty (until they repealed the ban in 1908).|Homosexuality was common and relatively accepted in ancient China, especially among the elite. Emperor Han Aidi (27 BC–1 BC) famously had a male companion, Dong Xian, and the story of him cutting off his sleeve to avoid waking Dong became a euphemism for same-sex love, known as ""断袖之癖"" (the passion of the cut sleeve).

By the Ming and Qing dynasties, homosexuality faced increasing stigmatization. During the New Culture Movement in the 1910s, Western ideas influenced societal views, and homosexuality became further stigmatized as a symbol of outdated or immoral practices. It was decriminalized in 1997, but the goverment currently still suppresses homosexuality being expressed publicly on media.|What must billions do now?|Nobody tell him about the Spartans.|What if I told you Taiwan has more respect for Chinese tradition than China does?|Wasn't relationship back then a ""top"" or ""bottom"" like?

It was considered a sin among theologians but it wasn't punished under the state's law. There were entire markets where boy slaves were sold for that purpose and many famous Muslims even Caliphs had boy slaves. One of those Caliphs was known to prefer them over girl slaves to the point that his mother made the girl slaves cut their hair and look boyish to stop him but she ultimately failed at her goal!|IIRC, the Japanese also had a tradition of the higher class sending their sons to become educated elites at their temples/monasteries and adopting feminine countenance, dress, etc, even serving as sexual servants until their graduation?

explanation for those confused :
this is D.W. Griffith, director of ""Birth of a Nation"" a notoriously racist film depicting the KKK as heroes. Unfortunately the film was also appearently quite well made and in general Griffith's work is seen as very influential for modern cinema, especially Hollywood. It also was extremely popular at the time leading to the KKK having a major resurgance in popularity after its release.

Often overshadowed (For understandable reasons) by his support for the Klan, his other political views were all over the place both irl and in his films. Ironically for his pro-KKK sentiment he was also against Prohibition.

He followed ""Birth of a Nation"" with a film called ""Intolerance"" which is about the evils of bigotry (yes the irony is palpable) Some people think that ""Intolerance"" was a means of apologising for BoaN but it was not, in fact it was made in protest of the fact people were ""Intolerant"" (in his Opinion) of Birth of a Nation and tried to censor it. And he insisted that BoaN was not in fact racist.|Griffith: *supports racial segregation, big fan of the KKK*

Also Griffith: “How could anyone think I’m racist?”|he was obviously trying to confuse everyone; that was his true goal the whole time|Y'know, it seems confusing from a modern perspective, but all of that sort of makes sense for the time (minus the part about insisting he wasn't racist while being a fan of the KKK).  Censorship at that time was mostly *against* groups like the KKK, and the politics at the time held that corporations were powerful and exploitative and that worker's rights were necessary to protect against, and just about everyone, including the people in the Klan, *were* workers or farmers who were still threatened by large corporations.  And thoughts on war can change very rapidly with time and depending on who's fighting- and he probably envisioned America conquering Europe as the noblest of war goals.  He did make a movie about Pancho Villa during an active civil war there, after all.|Chaotic neutral|\> Is into Tomboys

This guy is clearly skilled at making movies, but uses his talent and hard work to be a racist white supremacist.

This conflict pitted independence supporters against French forces, supported by the harkis, Algerians who served as auxiliaries in the French army for various reasons, such as loyalty to France, opposition to the FLN, or economic needs.

At the end of the conflict, the Évian Accords of March 1962 led to Algeria's independence, but they did not provide clear protection for the harkis. The French government, under President Charles de Gaulle, decided not to massively evacuate these fighters and their families, fearing tensions in metropolitan France and seeking to maintain good relations with the new Algerian government. As a result, most harkis were left behind in Algeria, where they were considered traitors.

The reprisals were brutal: between 60,000 and 70,000 were killed (some estimates suggest as many as 150,000), often under horrific conditions. Around 40,000 harkis and their families managed to flee to France, sometimes clandestinely, but many were housed in unsanitary camps, leading to lasting marginalization for them and their descendants.

So, Barley is the origin of nearly every measurement we use in the US… and is strongly related to the measurements that were used to give us metric before metric had been successfully finished and was able to produce more metric.
 
So, the middle 32 grains of barley from a stalk should be the fattest and most uniform in size. They are 1/3 of an inch, and as a result, 1/3 of an inch is called a “Barleycorn” which is how US shoe sizes are measured. Each time the shoe goes up 1/3 of an inch, it’s up a size.
 
Take that same barleycorn and weigh it. That is one “grain” in weight. Here in the United States if Yee-Haw, that is how we measure gunpowder! It’s a unit of weight of propellant.
 
Lastly, I swear the Minim was related to it, but I can’t find that anymore, so I can’t link volume to barley!

It consisted of four Delhi proposals, the three Calcutta amendments, demands for the continuation of separate electorates and reservation of seats for Muslims in government services and self-governing bodies. In 1928, an All Parties Conference was convened in reaction to the All White  Simon Commission   (the latter appointed to discuss parliamentary reform in British India; met with protests). A committee was set up under Motilal Nehru which prepared the ""Nehru Report"". This report demanded ""Dominion Status"" for India. Separate electorates were refused and the reservation of seats for the Muslims of Bengal and Punjab was rejected. The Nehru Report did not uphold a single demand of the Muslim League. The report was given in a meeting of the council of the All India Muslim League on 9 March 1929. The Nehru Report was criticized by Muslim leaders Aga Khan and Muhammad Shafi. They considered it as a death warrant because it recommended joint electoral rolls for Hindus and Muslims.

In reaction to the Nehru Report, the League authorised Jinnah to draft in concise terms the basis of any future constitution for India. Jinnah aimed to safeguard the interests of Muslims. He gave his 14 points which covered the interests of Muslims and in these 14 points Jinnah stated it was the ""parting of ways"" and that he did not want anything to do with the Indian National Congress in the future. The League leaders motivated Jinnah to revive the Muslim League and give it direction. As a result, these points became the demands of the League and greatly influenced the Muslims' thinking for the next two decades until the establishment of Pakistan in 1947.

In March 1929, the Muslim League session was held in Delhi under the presidency of Jinnah. In his address to his delegates, he consolidated Muslim viewpoints under fourteen items and these fourteen points became Jinnah's 14 points and the manifesto of the All India Muslim League.  
The Fourteen Points:  
1)The form of the future constitution should be federal, with the residuary powers vested in the provinces.

2)A uniform measure of autonomy shall be granted to all provinces.

3) All legislatures in the country and other elected bodies shall be constituted on the definite principle of adequate and effective representation of minorities in every province without reducing the majority in any province to a minority of even equity.

4) In the Central Legislative Assembly , Muslim representation shall not be less than one-third

5)Representation of communal groups shall continue to be by separate electorates: provided that it shall be open to any community, at any time, to abandon its separate electorate in favor of a joint electorate.

6)Any territorial distribution that might at any time be necessary shall not in any way affect the Muslim majority in Punjab, Bengal, and North West Frontier Province

7)Full religious liberty, including belief, worship, observance, propaganda, association, and education, should be guaranteed to all communities.

8)One-third representation shall be given to Muslims in central and provincial cabinets.

9) No bill or resolution shall be passed in any legislature if three-fourths of the members of any community in that body oppose the bill

10)Sindh should be declared a separate province

11)Reforms should be introduced in the North West Frontier Province and Balochistan on the same footings as in the other provinces.

12)Muslims should be given an adequate share of all services, with due regard to the efficiency requirement.

13)The Constitution should embody adequate safeguards for the protection of Muslim culture, education, language, religion, and personal laws, as well as for Muslim charitable institutions.

14)No change will be made in the constitution without the consent of the province.

Reactions: Jawaharlal Nehru (son of Motilal Nehru) referred to them as ""Jinnah's ridiculous 14 points"".The congress leaders refused to accept the Jinnah amendments as Jinnah's proposals envisioned a weak centre and more autonomy to the provinces.|The partition of India is amongst the big clusterfucks of the 20th century.

740,Waterloo is just one example,https://i.redd.it/eizc7fb38ybe1.jpeg,4457,2025-01-09 16:23:43,38,"The famous battle of Waterloo between Napoleonic forces and Coalition forces that took place on the 18th of June 1815 left more than 20.000 soldiers and horses from both sides dead. However, out of those 20,000 corpses, only *two* skeletons from soldiers who died at the battle have ever been found. The remaining tens of thousands of skeletons had mysteriously disappeared. Recently however, Belgian and German historians seem to have solved this mystery. According to them, the skeletons had been dug up by individuals to be sold to the sugar industry. 



You see, during the 19th century, extracting sugar from beets had gained popularity in Europe. During the Napoleonic Wars, the British used their superior naval fleet to blockade French trade routes to the West Indies, which made it difficult to import sugarcane from these territories. To solve this problem, Emperor Napoleon decreed for large areas to be used for the production of beets. From there on, sugar beets became the new trend in Europe, and many factories were created for the production of sugar.

In order to obtain sugar from beets, the beet is first put into hot water so that beet juice containing the sugar can be extracted from it. Then, impurities from the juice are absorbed by activated charcoal in order to isolate the sugar. However, it was discovered that bonechar (material derived from charring animal bones) also worked great as a filtering agent for isolating the sugar. To meet the demand for bones in the industry, locals started digging up skeletons from nearby cemeteries and sites from battlefields to sell it to factories. Not just Waterloo, but other sites from Napoleonic battles were affected by this hunger for bones as well. 



But it wasn’t just the sugar industry. As it turned out, bones also made for a great fertilizing material, due to the large amounts of phosphorus and calcium they contained. The British imported large amounts of bones to be reduced to bonemeal so that it could be used in their agriculture. They scoured the entire continent and beyond, looking for ‘the white gold’. Even human remains from tombstones and pyramids that were thousands of years old were not safe. This dog-like hunt for bones kept up all the way until the Great War. Nowadays however, bones are no longer used in agriculture or the sugar industry.

Also, why does that background in the bottom look familiar? Kingdom Come Deliverance?|People often forget that the main purpose of the catholic inquisition was essentially to get people deemed heretical to repent and publicly renounce to their heretical belifs. The main targets were intellectuals and philosophers, and a trial ending in a execution wasn't the prefered outcome fro the inquisition. In Spain the inquisition also targeted forcibly converted muslims and jews, who suffered from intense prejudice and were mostly accused of secretly practicing their original religions.

Many people are often surprised to know that the real inquisition didn't tackle witchcraft, which was mostly left to civil authorities. The Church's position on witchcraft changed noticably during the centuries, and during a large portion of the middle ages witchcraft was actually dismissed as pagan superstition. It was only in the early moder period (1400's-early 1700's) that Europe was swept by huge moral panics about witchcraft.|the Spanish inquisition only awarded the death penalty in about 2% of their trials, and they were one of the few courts in Europe at the time to place the burden of proof on the prosecution.|The Inquisition is a meme, it's ridiculous how misunderstood it is|The Inquisition, created by the Church in the 12th century, hunted down heresies. Minor offenses resulted in prayers or fines, but serious cases could end with execution by burning, though this was rare (around 3,000 executions over five centuries, according to Anne Brenon).

It all started with an Edict of Faith, a public call giving locals 15 to 30 days to confess or report others. Those who repented faced light penalties like pilgrimages or wearing a cross. Otherwise, investigations began, involving interrogations, anonymous testimonies, and sometimes torture to extract confessions.

Persistent heresies were judged in public ceremonies designed to make an impression. However, most penalties were mild: prayers, fines, or penances. Burnings were reserved for the most extreme cases. In the end, the Inquisition, while harsh, was less deadly than commonly believed, with its image amplified by 19th-century myths.|I've just started reading about WH40k so I'm by no means an expert

For example: Most of burning of witches was done not in medieval times but in early modern ones, usually by secular governments, sometimes not Catholic but Protestant ones.

Trivia: at some point of time, was possible for people accused of secular crimes like thief to get out of jail by using this procedure:

1. At secular court confess that you are heretic.
2. Now are you under Church court jurisdiction. Additional benefit: In most cases secular courts were far more cruel and unprofessional that Church ones, so you already has better situation.
3. Repeat confession during Church trial. Get some penance.
4. Performing penance means that you are free. Is possible that they also pardon your secular crime.

Usually, in such cases where the papal trial would want to put the accused to death they would instead sentence them to ‘relaxation’, which is something of a euphemism. The accused is ‘relaxed’ to the secular authorities who do have the power to perform executions and lack the spiritual purity imperative.

Yes it’s true that conversion and spiritual purity through ‘peaceful’ means was the goal, and I’m all for more detailed understandings of history, but in tune with this increased detail you should keep in mind that forced conversion under the threat of feudal and spiritual violence is a terrible thing. There is a very real moral core to the fact that we stopped doing that (mostly, I happen to live in a place where systemic forced conversion by a state-supported entity is still in living memory), and you would do well to remember that.

Imagine that Europeans come to Australia and are met with raids by cavalrymen, who instead of being on the back of their mounts, sit in their belly pouches.|Pretty much the same thing happened in North America.

Eurasia had horses and cows and was generally a much better spawn point.|If only the horse and camel didn’t go extinct in the americas what could’ve happened?|Misinformation in this thread aside, I'd like to point out that prior to European colonisation completely degrading the landscape food was very easy to come by. An absurd number of native plants are edible and many were actively cultivated. Murnong, bunya pines, Mitchell grass, kangaroo grass and various tubers were literally farmed and plenty of other food was easily harvestable in the wild (e.g. wattles grow everywhere).  

Many indigenous groups would conduct ""kangaroo drives"", drawing dozens or more of them into areas fenced off with tall nets so they could select the best ones for food and release the rest.  

Fish farms were also common both along the coast and in inland areas. The oldest man-made structure still in existence is potentially the Brewarrina fish traps in central NSW, consisting of carved stone locks and weirs. Some estimates put it at over 20,000 years old, however archaeology in this country is a sad joke so it will be a very long time before rigorous studies are done.  


Basically, outside of drought years most of precolonial Australia was a relatively easy place to live. Just keep an eye out for snakes.|Well, to say that Indigenous Australians didn’t have agriculture would be incorrect. They were planting seeds and had large areas of land dedicated to specific types of plants.

Also, while they didn’t domesticate any animals, their knowledge of Australians seasons and the land meant that they never needed the security of domesticated animals, always knowing how and where to find food.

I would say that the variation of Australian seasons would be the best reason for why they never settled in one place (the term “civilisation” is really condescending). I can’t speak for all parts of Australia, but where I live there are about seven regular seasons plus dry and wet periods that switch every 2-10 years. Settling down and creating a farm in Australia was only really possible when the English came because they had an empire with a vast trade network that could support it.

One last bit of advice: never call an Indigenous Australian an aboriginie|Civilization is when you enslave people and commit genocide, and have swell heirachies like kings, capitalism  and the church.


If you don't have heirarchy or empires you're not civilized, and theirfore not real people right?|They did begin to start farming fish by the time Europeans arrived, if I recall correctly.|Tbh indigenous Australians had the lifestyle on lock before the euros arrived|Explanation: a lack of domesticable plants and animals forestalled the development of civilization in Australia, leaving the Aboriginals as hunter-gatherers.|They had partially domesticated several plants, and their system of fire farming large swaths of the country to control the otherwise horrendously flammable vegetation was apparently very efficient. 

Stuff like berry corridors, growing quangdongs in patterns along the routes used to move around their areas were fairly wide spread. Their system of different animals being off limits to different groups meant that even if a local population was over hunted, there was still some nearby that could recover the population.|I bet if some aliens with the same mindset landed on Earth 100,000 years ago, they’d say the same thing: these poor Earthlings have no animals to domesticate. I mean, look at these horses -they’re so tiny, they can’t carry anyone or pull anything. Plus, they’re stubborn and unruly; you can’t teach them a thing. Same with those aurochs -wild and aggressive, no use for anything. And wolves? Timid when alone, bloodthirsty in packs, and completely untrainable. Nope, nothing to work with here. Guess these Earthlings are doomed to stay in the Stone Age forever.

Because in reality, every domesticated species came from wild ancestors that we’d probably describe today as “impossible to domesticate.” It took thousands of years of selective breeding to turn the tiny, stubborn horse into the powerful, obedient creature we know today.

Some cultures simply figured out that animals could be domesticated and their natural abilities harnessed, while others didn’t. The idea that certain animals are suited for domestication while their often closely related cousins from another continent aren’t is classic historical revisionism -often with a political agenda behind it.

EDIT: annoying typo that was driving me crazy|Australia has plenty of native domesticable plants, the big problem was the lack of founder crops of any kind.|[This ist just plain wrong!](https://youtu.be/Ska2fpueDLA?si=hVYSu4zokGY6F27p)|I feel like this greatly trivialises Australian Aboriginal history and falls on harmful stereotypes.

They absolutely did have agriculture but the unique landscape and environment of Australia made them farm in a very novel way with migration being a key part, traveling between hunting areas managed by controlled burns to allow food to regrow.

Written accounts record seeing hills of yams etc which they attributed to ""god shaping the land"" and small dam like fish traps which allowed them to reach and catch fish at leisure, this was considered proof that another white man had taught them.

We can see evidence of how expertly they maintained the land such as the gum trees which require fire to germinate which would have evolved due to the consistent back burning they did over thousands of years.

nomadic tribes cultivated yams in sites along their migration routes, harvested them when passing through and deliberately replanted them.

its kinda wild to go ""waaah they didn't have agriculture"" just because they weren't using slave labor to grow wheat in neat little lines like the mesapotamians.

""civilisation"" is pure ass for thousands of years, nothing but tyrants and slavery and war and TAXES, until you get to modern medicine and even then it still sucks, and when europeans tried forcing it on aborigines they were like ""dude fuck off"" and now we're all miserable together.

Finally anyone who believes this forgot the elephant in the room that is the Royal Navy which the Germans would then have to destroy which would be a monumental task on its own.

Now with less pilots, less planes, less experience and less fuel destroying the Royal Navy (which are just floating AA emplacements) is basically an impossible chance given the Kriegsmarine was relegated to U boasts and small ships after the larger boats were blown up.

The reality is that the Nazis had not intended to be at war with Britain and did not plan to be at war with Britain.

Especially to Rommel and Rundstedt, the generals whom would actually have to face it. They also often butted heads, the most famous being Rundstedt wanting all their panzers to be concentrated in an armored fist to smash the landings, whilst Rommel wnated them to be deployed as close as humanly possible to the landings to crush them as they landed.

However, in one odd aspect the generals were both in agreement, both of them expected that they would receive substantial V2 support by way of bombardment of the landing sites. The Nazis's newest weapon was the first supersonic missile, and it was not only hoped but expected that even if they fell short of every other aspect, they would at least have the advantage of having a form of attack the allied bombers/navy/air defense couldn't stop.

Therefore, both were absolutely stunned when, a few weeks before D-Day, they were informed in a meeting that the V2s were so inaccurate it could hardly be guaranteed for them to hit London, Britain's largest city, let alone the mile long beaches the two were hoping it would hit. Both had apparently been under the impression that the V2s were accurate enough to at least have a high hope of hits, crushing the landings as they took place.|The only known tactical use of the V2 was against the Ludendorf bridge with 11 missiles being fired.

Several hundred years later, a manga writer named Akira Toriyama created a manga loosely based on Journey to the West called Dragon Ball. This series became immensely popular and its sequel series Dragon Ball Z even more so. Dragon Ball Z would lead the anime boom of the 1990’s, and it’s quite possible anime and manga would not have gained popularity in America were it not for DBZ.

I read somewhere that when Maria died, Frederick complimented her achievements and said that while they’ve been opponents, he never considered her his enemy. And while this statement could of course be just him trying to be diplomatic towards Austria, I like to imagine that at his older days Frederick was like: ”GG Maria, it was fun”|You're really gonna knock an 18th century pregnant woman for not riding into battle?|I mean, Frederick didn't had to deal with a war of succession involving most of the European Powers as soon as he took over the reins of government like Maria Theresa had to do, not to mention that all of these European powers had been delighted to receive her father's ""gifts"" in order to acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction only to conveniently retract themselves as soon as the Emperor died.

And I honestly don't think it's fair to compare how each of them literally ""fought their battles"" - she was a woman, she wasn't supposed to be on the front lines, and as such she didn't receive an education for it, Frederick did.

And all that without mentioning the disparity in the quality of the inheritance received by each one from their respective parents and predecessors.|Didn’t she have like 16 kids? Seems kinda rough to lead from the front when constantly pregnant.|Frederick was impressive, but he really, really lucked out when Empress Elizabeth of Russia died and her heir Peter III. was a giant prussia fanboy. Otherwise the Anti-Prussia coalition of Austria, Russia, France and Sweden would have had him dead to rights at the end of the Seven Year war. At the one hand it is also impressive that he was such a threat that those states united against him and that he was able to hold them off, but on the other hand such a coalition forming in the first place isn't a great sign regarding his diplomatic statecraft. Napoleon was a military genius and in many ways a visionary statesman but what do those traits truly mean if his country still ends up occupied and he an exile. Frederick very easily could have shared that fate if not for a lot of luck. 

Besides he inherited a very different state from a vastly more competent predecessor and as first born son was in a far easier position to assume and exercise power contrary to Maria Theresa who was the first female ruler of the Habsburg dominion. Not that fair of a comparison. Also Maria Theresa had some significant accomplishments like sponsoring smallpox inoculation and enacting much needed reforms of the Habsburg monarchy.

> David Lang was said to be a farmer who lived near Gallatin, Tennessee. On September 23, 1880 he supposedly vanished into thin air while walking through a field near his home. His wife, children, and two men who were passing by in a buggy all witnessed his disappearance.

> Seven months later his children were said to have heard their father's voice faintly calling out for help as they played near the spot of his disappearance, but eventually the sound of his voice faded away. They never heard his voice again.

> During the 1970s, researchers who contacted a Tennessee librarian named Hershal Payne unearthed a possible source for the tale. Payne said that he had heard some people attribute the tale to a well-known hoaxer who lived in Tennessee during the 1880s, Joseph Mulhattan. Supposedly Mulhattan invented the tale while participating in a lying contest, and with time the story became part of local legend. But despite this rumor, there is no evidence that Mulhattan was the source of the tale.

> It is more likely that the tale of David Lang was invented by the mystery-novel writer Stuart Palmer. In July 1953 Palmer published the earliest known account of the Lang story in FATE Magazine. Palmer's article was almost certainly the source that both Wilkins and Edwards later relied upon.

> Palmer claimed that the tale had been told to him by Sarah Lang, the daughter of David Lang. But in reality, Palmer probably lifted the idea for the tale from a short story by Ambrose Bierce, ""The Difficulty of Crossing a Field,"" which Bierce included in his story collection Can Such Things Be? (1893). Bierce's story describes a plantation owner who vanishes into thin air. In his 1953 article, Palmer claimed that Bierce's story was inspired by the Lang incident. However, the opposite is most likely true -- the Lang tale written by Palmer is almost certainly a reworking of Bierce's story.|is that badger|This is literally me after trying to explain my feelings",HistoryMemes,1hxa4dm

The Persians at the time may have had an army of 150k and they would have received thousands of allied troops from subject nations. Alexander would clearly have had a bad time in India as his Malian campaign showed, but let’s not pretend like he was not militarily very capable. He routinely outmanoeuvred enemies and his father had developed what was probably the most advanced military of the time.|His army went as far as Gandhara in the Himalayas foothills.

If you do the whole distance straight between Pella (ancient capital of Macedonian Kingdom) to Alexandria Hypasis (nowadays Amritsar, Punjab, back in days the most eastern city his Empire expanded) by walk without resting, it would take 1326 hours or 55 days and about 5900 kms (according Google Maps).

And below, you have the conquest road of Alexander with dates.

Mofo could have failed far before reaching Babylon, betrayed by his men or too confident like Crassus when he tried to spank the Parthians. You needed a real charisma, force of conviction, strategic gifts and godlike aura (plus a bit of luck) to go this far at the time in an expansionnist mission.

[Alexander The Great Empire in 323 BC](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fzeav0i4c05k31.jpg)|why was the Indian subcontinent historically so easy to conquer when they're massive, in terms of size, population and economy, they're bordered by dense jungles in the East, impenetrable mountains in the north, ocean in the south and a river in the West.

They basically have geographical plot armor, with shitloads of people and shit loads of money.

Why were they so weak historically?| Isn’t the fact that Alexander the Great conquered everything from Greece to the Himalayas **with** such a small army the reason why people are impressed?|As if the Persian army was tiny lmao|Alexander the Great's standing army was much larger than 45K: 45-50K was the expeditionary force he took with himself to Asia, at the battle of Megalopolis his lieutnant Antipater who was left to manage Greece fielded another 40K men who had stayed back, so that would be already 90K. Ofc Alexander also integrated conquered populations into his army, inheriting the shah's former army basically, so by the time he was back to Babylon he would have had on paper the largest army on the planet. And ofc in terms of combined arms, tactics etc its professional core was much ahead of everyone else on the planet although I suspect the Warring states-era Chinese would have been a very close second.

Also as a sidenote, Chinese accounts regarding numerical composition of armies are so obviously overblown they make Herodotos look modest, but unlike the latter they receive nearly 0 scrutiny with many instead accepting them at face value because muh veil of orientalistic mystique muh mysterious ancient China and basically too many wuxia movies tend to blind people like peplum movies did for the Classical era once.|We don't know what would've happened if Alexander attacked India proper

The Nanda Empire was pretty unpopular (according Mauryan sources which I'm sceptical of) in the subcontinent but FAR from weak

It took Chanakya and Chandragupta wreaking havoc from inside before they could successfully topple the Nandas

Maybe Alexander would've played on the Nanda unpopularity or Alexander's army would've lost their will to fight upon seeing the elephants.

We don't know|Isn’t that more impressive rather than less?

Dude conquered everything from Greece all the way to the border of India. Meanwhile China is just beating itself up.

One is clearly more successful than the other|The numbers are ridiculous, and this is a well-known fact amongst Orientalists (European meaning of the word). You will still find sources that claim that Bai Qi (白起; 332-257 BC) was personally responsible for over one million deaths, when the ENTIRE population of China at the time was a little over 40 million people.
Those who actually believe this need to have their brains checked.

So no, the numbers are off.
That said, military strategy was not exactly the forte of either the Indian or the Chinese kingdoms.
Alexander would have lost eventually, but after inflicting horrendous damage to the enemy.|People actually believe that the Nanada Empire had 250000 Thousand mens?|That 45 k defeated an army of 1 million and 40 thousand strong at Gaugamela according to Arrian.|China’s numbers are astronomical but Chinese historical losses are extremely rough estimates. They basically equal “amount of people we can no longer account for”. It’s why anytime there’s a war or rebellion ten million die, it’s because a hundred census offices burned down covering ten million people. |I really don't know what point you're trying to make here, Alexander did more with less?|Not always about quantity, he had the best army on the planet at the time|But how reliable are those numbers exactly?|Chinese history is absolutely wild. It’s crazy how so many people died just because of whims of ruling parties.|How Alexander managed to conquer all of the Achaemenid's Realm is beyond me. Imagine maneuvering a 50k army around the enemy's territory while facing forces 2 to 3 times the strength of your army.

The closest thing I could think that replicates this feat is Hannibal's march around Italy during the Second Punic War and Heraclius' during the final Roman-Sassanid War. 

On how Heraclius commanded the LAST standing Roman field army against multiple Sassanid armies in order to reconquer lost territories is beyond me.|Achaemenid Empire of 480 BC had a population of roughly 45 to 50 million people, which was at the time around 40-45% of the overall global population.  
Numbers are probably different to Alexanders time 150 years later, but the point is even globablly the Achaemenid Empire was no small player. Sure, India and China held probably most of the population outside of Achaemenid Empire, but still...

Also not only quantity but also quality matters.|NGL but he would smash pretty much every in Indian or Chinese army.

His soldiers were just on another level.|The army you can mobilize =/= the army you can bring to one place at a given time.
