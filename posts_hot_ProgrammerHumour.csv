Get outta here, we need professionals.""|When I was getting ready to graduate with my degree, I was looking for a job. As a CompSci major, I expected I'd get a programming job.

One of the job postings wanted 10 years experience with Java. This was in 1999, when Java was only about 4 years old. I emailed them asking about that requirement. Their response indicated it was for a ""senior developer"" position and they required a minimum of 10 years experience with a language before they would consider anyone as senior developer in that language. I pointed them to a page indicating how long Java had been extant and explained that the creator of the language didn't have 10 years experience with it.

Someone in HR had written it and, as usual, they knew nothing about the tech for which they were advertising.

Except no. Without those requirements, users would be idiots and use all text passwords or at best alphanumeric, capital letters and spaces if I'm being generous, which gives an input space of n^63 where n is the length of the password. Just including the special characters that can be easily accessed on a keyboard bumps that up another 25-30, depending on layout, so that becomes n^~90. The fact that you can't have alphanumeric reduces that space down to, still n^~90, because that's not how this works.

Also, more importantly, it makes dictionary attacks less feasible (yes, you can add the rules into the dictionary, but that still raises the number of possible attacks from ""password"" or ""Password"" to ""P@ssword"" ""P!assword"" ""p@ssW*rd"" and so on and so forth. 

Of course, users are still bad at choosing passwords (me included), and everybody should use a password manager, which makes this entire thing a moot point.|This kinda assumes a uniform distribution over the input space, and ignores the fact that users are stupid (most of my own passwords end with an exclamation mark..)|Length is far more important than complexity.  if you take four random dictionary words and just concatenate them together, all in lowercase, you'll have a decent password, provided you can remember it",ProgrammerHumour,flvurz

In case anyone is wondering what's happening here, it looks like a specific edge case in a Pandas DataFrame. For those unfamiliar, a DataFrame is basically a spreadsheet. Each column has a type (though that type can be `object`). The `any()` method on a DataFrame returns a Series with the result of each column's `any()` method call. That result can then have its `any()` method called to return a `bool`.

Pandas has plenty of edge cases like this, and they can result in the wrong thing happening. However, in general I think the devs have actually done a pretty good job providing good compromises between usability and flexibility.",ProgrammerHumour,bvadja
