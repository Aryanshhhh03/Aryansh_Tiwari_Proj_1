Since the rules of discourse require all involved parties to value certain principles over and above their disagreements-- namely, that open and honest communication are important and that even if we disagree, we all have the right to say what we think and that if we want our own ideas engaged with, we must engage directly with the ideas of others and address their merit rather than resort to insults and logical fallacies, even if we really really don't like it.""

Unfortunately, I think modern conservatives have reached a position where they consider liberals an inhuman enemy who does not deserve to be engaged with like a fellow countryman. An inhuman enemy doesn't deserve to be told the truth, and doesn't deserve to be acknowledged when it points out the lies. 

And I really think the Republican party has boiled down to care about two things now: abortion and immigration. Abortion is a tough cookie: if you think abortion is baby murder, then you might feel justified in just about anything to stop it. (Nevermind that countries with safe, legal abortions [have fewer abortions.](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide). I understand that one might feel like the ends don't justify the means, but there it is.)

Immigration is maybe the toughest cookie because it plays hell with peoples' intuitions and stirs up more us-vs-them sentiment than your team playing the Superbowl against their nemesis team. Most people don't think of themselves as racist and people REALLY hate the idea that they're unconsciously racist-- it's like being blamed for existing, I get it. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen, and it's not going to be easily apparent if you're not a person of color, but if the sentiment is there, it can be played on by someone giving a speech. I think Republicans feel like mentioning racism is some sort of ""haha, I, the liberal said the word 'racism' and so I have won the argument!!"" device. But to deny that the Republican party is racist is, at this point, to deny reality. The thing about racism is that it doesn't paint itself a big RACISM sign. Nobody picks up a microphone and says ""ok, I'm gonna do some racism now!"" 

Instead, look at Breitbart. They had a section devoted, specifically, to black crime. They were just reporting facts; how can facts be racist? The answer is that the racist mindset is one of cherry picking things that support that worldview while ignoring evidence to the contrary. There was no corresponding ""black philanthropy"" section. No ""black volunteering and outreach."" Breitbart readers wanted to think about black people, and they wanted to think about black people in one context: crime. And yes, black people do crime-- because they're people. And if all you ever think about black people is the crimes committed by black people, you'll stop thinking of them as people and start thinking of them as a threat you need to protect your family from (even if the nearest black person in reality lives a hundred miles away, is a doctor who's married with three kids and volunteers at church on Sunday.)

Oh, umm, I meant Republicans bad.|*Sort by controversial*|Look, I'm all for advocating that both parties are bad, but Republican's are borderline monsters, they vote in such psycopathic ways that make me question their sanity. They push religion into a secular democracy. Some of them straight up advocate for a facistic form of government. They advocate for violence against dissenters and just play brutal strongman politics. Democrats are corrupt bad yada yada yada. But you'll never see a Democrat advocate for the uprooting of democracy. Republicans scare me with how little empathy they have, they scare me with how cruel they can be without a second thought. It not okay, and looking at how Republican's are becoming more and more extreme every year, their right wingism is is starting to catch up with previous facistic regimes. To say both parties are equally bad is not okay, the Republican party in office rn are borderline monsters.|Because the Republicans aren't a bunch of warmonging, corrupt sell-outs that would sacrifice the health of their constituents for a quick buck, right?

It's alarming that people would upvote such a low-quality piece of blatant right-wing propaganda.",PoliticalHumour,9u363u

Plurality voting practically teaches people how to make false dichotomies and then choose one. It's extremist-inducing and idiotic.


If anyone is looking to get involved with something that can help the situation, take a look at https://www.equal.vote/starvoting.

Voting is one of - if not the - very most basic foundations and factors in a democracy. We need to change how we vote if we want to make meaningful and lasting change to the system.
