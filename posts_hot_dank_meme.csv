The first time I got absolutely shitfaced drunk one of my friends had to carry me home. My Mum offered for him to sleep over but he chose to walk home to Redfern (not a good place for teen boys to be walking alone at 3am in 80s Sydney). Anton you're a fucking legend and always have been.

None of my mates were willing to sleep over at my place because my Mum would hover in attack mode until she had to land and refuel. This was actually great for teen me because it meant I got to sleep over at their place and my Mum assumed their parents were as nuts as she was/is.

I also watch a lot of youtube on my TV, so while adblock was working well when I watched youtube on my computer, I only watched youtube about 1% of the time on there. 

So for a total cost increase of a few dollars over spotify, I now get no ads on any of the devices I watch on, and can download stuff to watch when I don't have internet, which worked well on some plane rides I recently took. 

I preferred the UI of spotify, and would say youtube music is a downgrade overall, but I'm a happy youtube premium user now.

Yes we have all of these amenities that are really awesome, but do you know how we lived before the agricultural revolution? It was far from sunshine and daisies but the point is that we were carefully, through natural selection, made to live that way. 

Ever since the agricultural revolution we have been fighting against evolution, nature, and ourselves. It can be fucking exhausting for most people, regardless of where you are in the world.

My wife had this when she was on cymbalta and went away when she started Zoloft. Antidepressants are not magic bullets, they are far from perfect but maybe talk to your DR about changing and see if this improves. Feel better out there my man.|[removed]|[removed]|Idk where people got the idea that the absence of depression or sadness results in happiness. As if happiness is the base feeling but it gets clouded by depression. 

Not to mention the two feelings can coexist. At least in my experience that is.|Yep. I’d rather feel nothing than continually wish I were dead. So. Yay?|Ok so I know this is a meme but you might need to do a genetic test to see which antidepressant you should be taking. You can request your doctor do this. 

If you’re not taking the right thing, it will make you feel like a zombie. 

My partner went through something similar before finding the right medication.|The point of antidepressants is to get you stable so you can work on the things that make you depressed. They are no magical cure but an opportunity to fix yourself.|I do feel ya on this OP, but I also want to say for anyone reading - antidepressants can be very different, even within the same ""type"" of medication.

Finding the right med for you can be a fucking *process*, but I just wanna reassure anyone going through it currently (or considering starting) that it's extremely worth it.

It took me I want to say a good 1.5 - 2 years to find what worked for me. Those were some rough times - just an endless cycle of getting prescribed a medicine, taking it for 3 months, finding some unpleasant side effect (the 'empty' feeling you mention, decrease in sexual appetite, inability to orgasm, mood swings, constant anxiety/jitters, the list goes on...), talking to my psychiatrist and getting switched to a new med, and repeat. For over a year. Truly a rollercoaster of unpleasant times.

But then I found the one. For me, it was Wellbutrin - it wasn't like a night and day instant improvement, but after the taper period I didn't notice any side-effects. So I kept on it. I wouldn't say I generally felt incredibly happy or 'cured', but it wasn't causing issues so I stuck with it. Have been for ~7 years now. 

There have been times I've wondered if it is even doing anything, but every so often I forget to bring my meds on a trip, or forget a couple days in a row, or *whatever* - bottom line, I get a little peek at what my head is like off my meds. And it's consistently *so much worse* than I remember. I'm easily annoyed, more pessimistic, find less joy in activities, dislike interacting with people, mean to others...*that* is the ""night and day"" feeling for me. And while it's certainly exaggerated due to my body expecting the meds and not getting them, it is a peek into what my head *used* to be like, and always puts into perspective how much that period of trying meds until I found ""mine"" was worth it. 

I'm not instantly ""happy"", but my head isn't getting in the way of me being happy anymore. I'm more level-headed, able to handle stress/sadness better, and enjoy the things that bring me happiness more than ever before. When you're in the thick of depression, it can feel like nothing you do works - you can do whatever you want but you'll still be unhappy, just due to your brain chemistry. Finding the right med for you just removes that 'dampening effect' and lets the things you do to improve your mental state *actually work*. Exercising *actually* gives me more energy. Socializing *actually* feels fulfilling. Engaging in a hobby *actually* brings me a lot of joy. 

And that is SUCH an incredibly powerful difference. You actually feel like you have the tools and ability to fight back against your depression, and when you do - you reap the rewards. Really starts to form a powerful positive feedback loop and does a lot to boost you out of that hole and into a happier place, even if it doesn't necessarily feel like it on a moment-to-moment basis.

Anyway. That was a lot of text - this meme just really resonated with me and I wanted to share a little about my experiences going through these feelings on multiple meds to reassure others that good things are possible! There are *so many* meds out there to try, and one not working doesn't mean others - even similar ones - won't. It's added *so much* to my life and general wellbeing, and I just want to encourage anyone going through this to keep pushing through. You'll thank yourself later, I promise! ❤️|They numb your brain. Occasionally your penis too.|Oh man, I have a real hard time explaining how antidepressants felt for me but this sums it up well. Just felt like a husk of a person.|Yeah it kinda sucks.

Media been, short of a few gems (f.e. Elden Ring, Stromlight Archive series) watered down and down and down for about 20 years now. 

Would rather replay GTA San Andreas instead of waiting for the new one, rereading the Republic Commando series and the proper Thrawn trilogy (SW ""Legends"") or go bump my way through MS Gundam from 1979. A weird time I tell you.|I love Solstice on the NES. It's ao punishing and you really need to get used to the 3D effect but if you stick with it, it's so satisfying jumping around doing the block carry double jump, freezing time, wiping out all the enemies in a room. Once you start to remember where all the checkpoints, extra lives and potion top ups, it gets really fun. Great exploration game. Very zippy too. Once you get good at it it's sooo fast breezing from room to room. I was so proud when I finally finished it. Love love love that game. Way ahead of it's time. Still fun today and omg the music is so cool. Tim Follin at his best. What a legend. Play it!|Same... I feel like the older games just have so much passion put into them. The developers had to come up with crearive solutions because the hardware was limited at the time, and oftentimes this is what makes the games so great imo. Its kinda hard to explain, but it seems like the limitations they were given sparked some kind of genius solutions idk.|So, why the sad face? Enjoy whatever you enjoy at any life stage|You should check Nebulous: fleet commander or carrier command|I get what you mean, i can say that there are some new games that are good. I would rather play older games or indie games. Recently started playing anvil saga. A few months ago, i restarted playing project zomboid. When one of the latest hitman was realised i was playing graveyard keeper. Booted up my old my and played carmagedon and max payne, for some reason it won't work on the new pc. Also, the dungeon keeper was on my list for a while. I wanna find a copy of gorasul legacy of the dragon, i know it bugged, but I never got to finish it back in the day. The only new game i want to play is the new stalker and the upcoming kingdom come delivarence.|Where dank, what is this fucking Facebook post|Glad I'm not the only one|Yes we exist|Imaginary nostalgia. Watch 'Midnight in Paris (2011)'.|its not older games or movies its just games and movies from your generation and you are getting older.|You are nostalgic for that time because you've tricked yourself into believing that something was different then than it is now but really things have pretty much been the same the entire time. 

The only real difference between gaming way back when and gaming now is that gaming now is a lot more monetized. 

And the easy way to get around that is it just not play those games those games usually suck anyway 

Play a game that is monetized in a fair way like Stellaris. 

An incredibly vast game where they are constantly adding things for free to the base game every time they bring a new pay DLC. 

So you don't even have to pay for anything other than the base game and every year maybe even more than once a year  you'll get new free content in there.

On the other side of that there are games like call of duty and fortnite where the games don't really offer much and then they charge you for everything else. 

And even the stuff they do offer is basically just watered down superficial junk",dank_meme,1hwl0j7

Also, using peak players to determine the success on single player or offline games is flawed to begin with.|Another day another short sighted Redditor that think that Horizon is some niche franchise|I absolutely loved the horizon games, the story especially, excited to see the movie (tho I didnt play the Lego game)|Brother this franchise had 2 main games and having played both of them.

Really crazy what they try to make you stay.|Sirius Xm.

I called to cancel and they gave me like 6 months for $20.|So this is a little adjacent to the topic at hand, but I've got a problem maybe y'all can help me out with:

I understand many of these companies will offer you a better rate if you call and threaten to cancel. But I also have perhaps too much empathy / deference for service workers due to my years in the industry and am kind of a pushover as a result. 

We've got an internet provider we're happy with. We signed up and got an introductory discounted rate for the first year. Awesome.

Well now that year is up. Obviously I don't want to pay $30 more per month for the same service, but at the same time - my partner and I are happy with the product we receive and both work from home so genuinely wouldn't want to deal with the headache of canceling and switching providers. 

People tell me all the time ""just call and threaten to cancel, they'll give you the discount rate again"". How exactly do you broach that conversation? If you don't intend (or would even be willing to) cancel, how do you go about having the conversation to get that cheaper rate again? 

Is it literally as simple as being candid with the representative and saying ""hey, the intro rate was great but the increased one is a little too expensive. Think we can get that intro rate again?"" Do you literally need to start the call with ""I'd like to cancel my service"" and hope they offer you the discount? Or is there some middle ground where you can say ""hey this new rate seems expensive, we're thinking about canceling but wanted to call and see what our options are"" (fully intending to never call back if they can't offer you anything)?|I do this with car insurance every time they up my rate.
