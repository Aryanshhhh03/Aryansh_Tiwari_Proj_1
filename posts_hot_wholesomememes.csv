I wish this was addressed by reddit and not subreddit mods

I'm not totally against reposting I've been guilty of reposting myself. but when a bot reposts and crosspost something a thousand times, it ruins the site.|💗|Thank goodness!! Truly appreciate the mods for taking a step towards getting rid of the bots. 

And thanks very much for that Mr. Rogers quote, i've been searching for it!! 😭|I feel like it'd be better to just go back to the subs roots and be a place for memes that are revised to become wholesome, rather than just like inspirational quotes or the like|I wish this were a site wide rule.

2,We need your OC wholesome memes please!,https://i.redd.it/wygooefq6lmd1.jpeg,33993,2024-09-03 17:48:47,463,"Hey there friends! It’s only been a few days since we started cracking down on the spam bots and excessive reposts that have been plaguing r/WholesomeMemes - and now there is nothing left!

Surely some enterprising content creators would see this vacuum as an opportunity to showcase their creativity, make people laugh, and been seen by *checks notes* 17 million people.

Before last week, I woke up each morning with disdain in my eyes seeing low quality reposts from spam accounts on the front page of Reddit. Honestly, most of the popular subreddits are cooked. It seems we might not be able to put the egg back in the chicken here. 

When I saw r/WholesomeMemes was open to help and new ideas, I pounced on the opportunity to help meowderate. We did the right thing, but now there are no posts coming through that are not spam. If you aren’t a spam bot and submitted an OC wholesome meme but it didn’t get approved, please send us a modmail. 

I am working with the other mods to come up with guides and contests to encourage people to post (hopefully in the next week or so), but until then we need your help! 

Here are some easy and basic tools to help you make memes:

https://imgflip.com

https://www.mematic.com

Heck, as long as it is original content you can even hand draw it as long as it is wholesome (not just cute) and a meme.

Feedback is GREATLY APPRECIATED!

Edit: Please note that we may take up to 24 hours to approve your meme. We are humans with lives and stuff.

Edit 2: Thank you everyone who made memes! Please no more “Mods vs The Bots” memes or other meta Reddit content. They will be removed moving forward.|Hang on a second, unless I'm mistaken the last actual post on this sub was two days ago. Are you guys saying that since bots have clamped down on, there have literally been no posts in the last two days? I know bots were a problem, but it really is depressing if such a huge sub such as this has almost no actual human posts.|Omg I didn't know you went OC only. I'll make a shitty meme right now!|You know things are bad when a cry for help makes you laugh out loud|This human joke is so funny, it makes me laugh with my lips and teeth. Ha ha ha.|This isn't a wholesome meme. Should we report it?|You know what? I’d rather have a dead sub ripe for new creators to establish a new culture than a busy sub full of bots lying to me to capitalize off my attention.|I don't have much else to say than:

#Thank you!

And good luck as well. Yeah, it's not surprising that bots ran/run the big subs. I didn't expect it to the degree of no human posts!|I hate how true dead internet theory is|okay I will upload daily then -|Good job getting rid of the bots! Sure the content might’ve taken a hit, but I’ll take less post made by humans any day over bot garbage|![gif](giphy|26DNc9KWmxRd8nkUU)

(Show: ""Nathan for you"" He tries to help small business owners with crazy schemes to get more business)|Are you saying you miss the bots??|Oh thank fuck|I would rather see a few posts a day instead of the same reposts from bots 1000x a day|**I Have a Dream of a Better Reddit**

I have a dream that one day, on the vast plains of the internet, Reddit, this mighty platform of endless potential, will rise up and live out the true meaning of its promise: “Quality, creativity, and novelty for all.”

I have a dream that one day, deep within the threads of every subreddit, I will no longer have to scroll through the weary echoes of yesterday’s memes and yesterday’s ideas. I dream of a Reddit where every post, every image, every story is fresh, bursting with the creativity of minds unshackled by the chains of repetition.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, in the endless expanse of this platform, there will be a beacon, a function—a function that will guide us through the flood of new content. It will shine brightly, showing us the best and brightest of what Reddit has to offer, while gently reminding us of the gems of the past, not as a burden of repetition, but as a respectful nod to the brilliance that has come before.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, every repost, every regurgitation of what has been, will be gently but firmly turned away at the gates. No longer will the past haunt the present, for the future demands space to breathe, to grow, to flourish in ways unimagined by those who came before.

This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to Reddit.

With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discord of stale content into a beautiful symphony of new and diverse voices.

With this faith, we will be able to work together, to browse together, to laugh together, to uplift this platform together, knowing that every time we refresh that feed, we are met not with the ghosts of old posts, but with the spark of something new, something inspiring, something worth our time.

This will be the day when all Redditors, old and new, will be able to rejoice and say, “Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free from reposts at last!”

And if Reddit is to be a great platform, this must become true.

So let the fresh content ring from the mighty mountains of r/funny.

Let the fresh content ring from the heightened peaks of r/AskReddit.

Let the fresh content ring from the diverse lands of r/pics and r/gifs.

Let the fresh content ring from every hill and molehill of Reddit’s sprawling communities.

From every subreddit, let fresh content ring.

And when this happens, when we allow fresh content to ring, when we let it ring from every community and every thread, we will be able to speed up that day when all Redditors, young and old, casual and devoted, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old internet hymn:

“Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free from reposts at last!”",wholesomememes,1f7ygfw

Compliments are absolutely earned, not just given. Women tend to get more compliments from men because they put more effort in - style their hair nicely in a way that suits them, wear outfits rather than random clothes, learn what style and application of makeup best complements their features, etc. 

Like I said, if you do these things already and still don't get compliments, this comment doesn't really apply to you, and I hope you'll get some soon, but if you don't do them but do want compliments, it starts with you. Style your hair in a more flattering way if you don't, start putting together what you wear as an outfit rather than putting on whatever.

You’re doing great!|I know this is probably going to sound awful, but this year went alright for me despite losing my mom in August.


We didn't have a strained relationship, we disagreed on quite a few things but other than that she was a great mom. The reason I say my year went alright, and something I didn't even realize until she had passed, I was always stressed out about her health. She had a lot of problems and disliked hospitals, getting her to go see a doctor was a battle. I miss her, so much, and the month after was one of the worst of my life. But once I was able to get myself back up, I felt less weight on my shoulders.


I know she'd be glad for that as well, she always hated me waiting on her and doing things for her. I haven't said this to anyone I know, cause I don't think I'd get anyone to understand.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wholesomememes) if you have any questions or concerns.*|I disagree. Forgiveness is where you are either able to understand why someone performed an action and no longer hold it against them, or you see that they have sufficiently made up for their past mistakes and you see they have grown as a person and no longer are the same person.

You can move on from someone's actions without forgiving them. One of my best friends cheated on his girlfriend, another very good friend of mine. For a long time I was angry at my friend, because first of all cheating is terrible, and I see as a moral failing, and secondly he caused an entire split in our friend group. However after some time I was able to move on and meet up with him again, however I didn't forgive him. It wasn't until way later that I saw that he grew as a person when I forgave him.|I'm sorry, but there are people that have done me really wrong.I still have those scars and their acts were unforgivable|So why the fuck is it called forgiveness?|You can let things go. That doesn’t equal forgiveness.|That's not forgiveness, that's letting go/moving on. Letting go is great! I think it's more important than forgiveness.

Forgiveness isn't always possible, and that's ok. Some things in life are unforgivable. It's ok to work through the pain someone caused and let go of it without ever forgiving the person for causing that pain in the first place.|That's definitely not forgiveness, but tolerance. Forgiveness is being willing to help correct a wrong with compassion and understanding.|You don't have to forgive to move on. The people who wronged you are the ones responsible for earning your forgiveness. The people who injured you may not own up to their actions. Do not let that hold you back. The best revenge is turning out the opposite of those who performed the injury.|This concept that we have to forgive to move on is bullshit. You can stop letting something effect your everyday life but not forgive the person. Acceptance is for you, forgiveness is for the other person/relationship.|The people that preach the power of forgiveness most often are those who seek to manipulate you with it.|Forgiveness was a long road for me. I grew up under a verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive narcissist. I've been no contact now for about eight years, and I held onto my unforgiveness for so long because I felt I'd earned it; I felt I'd earned the right to hate. As cliche as it sounds, I realized that it was eating me up. I had to try to forgive for my own sake, so one day, while alone,  I said, out loud, ""Dad, I forgive you"". I didn't tell him, just said it between me and God. Everyday for a year, I had to say it. Little by little I came to realize Dad was broken too, and hurt me (and others) because he was damaged as well. I'm still No Contact with him; forgiveness does not equal letting him back into my life to cause chaos and stress, but I've (mostly) let go of my hatred. I have flair ups; it's a work in progress and it always will be. Forgiveness is a decision I have to choose every day.|Then call it something else|Forgiveness is a continuous process because it closes wounds but doesn’t heal scars.|That's not really what forgiveness is. That's letting go, which is also good! Forgiveness - at least, under my moral framework - has to be earned by the person who wronged you.|Honestly it was therapeutic when I realized I was allowed to be angry and didn’t have to forgive someone.  Just accepting that helped me move past the abuse and trauma in my life.|forgiveness is a choice, one you can choose not to partake in. but just because you never forgive someone for something, doesnt mean you have to keep holding a grudge. letting go of a grudge will always be better for the self, but forgiving may not always be the better option for either of you|There are some people that I will never forgive, truly horrific people who did truly horrific things, but them and their actions hold absolutely no power over me.

She had heard that large crowds gathered to see the king, and so she would have all the more people to celebrate her birthday with her. On her way to the castle, the young girl came upon the crying woman and became upset that someone could be so sad on her special day. “Excuse me crying woman, don’t be so sad. It’s my birthday and a beautiful day out!” Hearing these words, spoken so sweetly by the little girl, the crying woman looked up. Through vision blurred by her tears the woman saw the bright blue of the sky with birds soaring high above in the warmth of the sun. She saw thick healthy trees covered in deep green leaves and heavy with ripe fruits. And she saw the river, strong and flowing through the gorgeous valley below. 

As she took in the sight of the gorgeous bountiful land surrounding her, her attention came to the soft caring face of the young child, a face filled with kindness and concern. “I don’t want you crying on my birthday” she said. “I don’t want ANYONE crying on my birthday. Today is a day to be happy!” The woman cracked a subtle smile, and a few more tears fell from her eyes. Not tears of sadness, but tears of appreciation, for she had forgotten what it felt like to be seen and to be cared for. The little girl spoke again “If you’d like, you can come to celebrate my birthday with the crowds of people gathered to see king Trump.” The woman’s face fell. “Wait, Donald Trump is our king? You have to be fucking kidding me!” Then she begin to sob, and sob, and sob, forevermore.|But the world is okay?

Also, we have been pretty strict about enforcing our new original content requirement as well as our long standing definition of wholesome being “uplifting and/or motivating” - so there have not been very many posts we can approve. We have updated some of our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/about/) and our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/s/zCP5V6KIip), but have more guidance, tools, and even some events on the horizon. We would love for you to share your OC memes / comics! Just keep in mind that it should be a meme (image/gif with text on or in it), it should be general (not specific to just you) so more people can relate to it, and not JUST a cute animal - if your meme features something cute, it must still be uplifting and/or motivating.

Reddit is great with tons of grown and mature pepole|Love this!|I wish she could do this :((|Absolutely, feelings are always valid! They are an essential part of being human and can provide important insights into our experiences and needs. Acknowledging and expressing our feelings helps us understand ourselves better and fosters deeper connections with others. It's important to honor what we feel, no matter what it is!|Not really and this conception is a huge problem in modern society for communication, social skills, logical thinking, emotional regulation and in the end the growth of the human race as a society.
To have feelings dont validate the cause of having these feelings to be legit from the aspect of causal correlations (i.e. ""over reacting""). And furthermore feelings arent an evidence that you are right on the base of logic - if you feel triggerd because of ""this and that"" it doesnt mean automatically that its legit and valid to be triggerd in the first place. Emotional reactions are irrational and the reason for a specific kind of an emotional reaction lays down in the subjectiv individuality of an ""I-Identity"" correlating with natural animalistic characteristics. 
But, you shouldnt judge your feelings and give them values; you should reflect the feelings from a rational perspective and become in control of them - in control of yourself at the end. 
And of course, emotions will close to always be before cognitions-by-will in the first place, because emotions are even the most latent motivations which lead to thinking about this or that at all. To think at the same time as to feel isnt something the most normal humans will ever achieve and is more like a buddha-thing for many people; its the classicaly ""to be in the Here&Now"" - it needs to be in a state of consistent critical reflection for which you need to sense everything you perceive and it needs deep understanding of the own ""Self"", which not many people are able to do. But you can come close to that state/flow of mind.|this is the kind of post that makes my day|Friend told me that the other day, really needed it.

All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”

I know it sounds cliché, but becoming a little better every day—waking up early, meditating, working, and ticking off to-dos—feels great. I’m becoming obsessed with discipline and confronting my fears. Writing my thoughts in my diary helps me understand myself a little better. To understand yourself, improve a little every day, and become the best version of yourself—this, I believe, is the meaning of life.

As Schopenhauer said, every moment an infinite number of potential yous are dying that are not the choices you made. The issue with FOMO is that you are invariably right, no matter how fully you live.  Best to accept that my life as it has been, and that bending my predispositions and re-educating my learned instincts in the direction of self-acceptance will be the work of a lifetime.  My light will never shine that evenly, but it can be a kintsugi. It reminds me of a nice phrase ""I live and love in God's *peculiar* light"". |[removed]|This MF looks like he's about to microwave all my gunner drones before dropping a Planula|Is this OC?

* (**Rule #1**) All posts must be wholesome memes.
We're not saying this is unwholesome! Just that sub's focus is uplifting, unless nicing-up existing rude memes. There are already great subs for cute (/r/aww, /r/eyebleach, /r/rarepuppers), things that make us smile (/r/MadeMeSmile, /r/HumansBeingBros, /r/AnimalsBeingBros), or that give us the feels (/r/WholesomeFeels or /r/baww). This might also fit better in another sub in the [Wholesome Network](https://www.reddit.com/user/awkwardtheturtle/m/wholesome/). It's not a ""no"" - it's a ""not the best fit here,"" and another sub will be better.

1. Did one of the original 4 die or are they just recruiting extra help because the 4 of them are having trouble keeping up with the level of crime these days?

2. Assuming they want to keep the groups name the same the applicants would need to be a) Teenagers and b) Mutatated Turtles* - I suspect that the applicant pool may be quite small. If they are also going to insist on the successful candidate either being named after an Italian renecence  painter or being willing to change their name if successful they may be out of luck.

3. Hiring, rather than recruiting, seems to imply that it's a job rather a calling. Will the successful applicant be on the clock? Is there overtime, health benefits, a pension. Are they aware of and complaint with local laws that relate to the hiring of teenagers? Who confirms that they are?

A few years ago, my wife had an extra car, slightly beat up but safe and running. I had an ex-student who had a run of tough times: got a girl pregnant, had a special needs baby who required a lot of care. He was working 2 or 3 jobs to pay the bills. My wife decided to give him the car. Turned out that he... didn't have a license and wasn't ready to be a driver.

That day, a neighbor popped up who was caring for her terminally I'll mom and needed a car for the time she'd be here. My wife sold her the car for cheap (good deed 1), then turned around and gave my student the cash. No strings, no requests, has never even met the kid or his family.

When I got back for graduation, the bursar's office called me in and cut me a check for almost $2500 -- my stipend for room and board for that semester. I was so embarrassed that the college was paying me on my way out the door when many friends were already dreading their student loans.

I tell you what, I would have loved a family for the past 20 something years.|i was adopted at 7, with my baby sister, and i was always reminded that i was almost at an “undesirable” age to be adopted, and that i was super lucky i didn’t get separated from my younger sister

being told as a 7 year old that you were almost too old to get official parents is fucked up, as is being constantly reminded you’re lucky you didn’t end up being separated from ur sister and shoved in foster care. i mean, it was true, but fuckkkk. so yeah, my plan is to adopt an older child, and/or siblings💪 

i’ve always wanted to adopt, and later figured out i was gay, and then later also found out i was infertile lol. god really wanted me to adopt 😂|[removed]|I will say having fostered teenagers you are dealing with traumas that are difficult to fully grasp as well as behavioral issues that you did not contribute to and you don’t know why they have the behaviors. So it is a lot more difficult than parenting a child from a younger age because they have years of your parenting to blame for how they are. Still absolutely worth it every time|Well, I like the willingness to do it, but it’s still a lot harder than people think, even in the most perfect circumstances. We adopted my niece at 13. Lots of childhood trauma, but we are fairly well off, have raised 4 of our own kids, provided mental healthcare with medications and lots of therapy. But it was still the most stressful time of our lives. Hyper sexuality with boys, experimenting with drugs, attempted to sell pills at school, etc.   We never gave up on her and she graduated high school, didn’t get pregnant and took some college courses. Then she went off the rails and she moved out.  We did what we could. Just remember that children with childhood trauma often develop personality disorders. You have to be patient, on your toes, and willing to participate in family therapy with the child. Then as they become adults you have to accept how they turn out, good or bad.|Honestly this makes me wanna adopt teenagers when I’m a lil older and financially stable|This is all good and nice, but people shouldn't be carelessly optimistic about this. Traumatized kids can do more than just a little shoplifting and experimenting with some weed. Not all of them, of course, but it's something you really have to consider and take seriously, and no it cannot be fixed by ""just actually parenting I guess"".  
  
A kid might kill your dog to see if your ""I love you no matter what"" is just an empty phrase and you will abandon them (like the other adults in their life). They could be sexually abusive to other kids. They might smear their literal shit on your walls and furniture. They could be so destructive of their own life it will be impossibly hard to watch.|I admire people who feel ready to deal with any types of kids|[removed]|I've really wanted to adopt older kids in the future and this post describes why perfectly|I always said if I adopted, I'm adopting someone who can speak in a sentence. It's easier for someone to tell me what they need, than me having to guess based on crying.|No sure about other states but in Ark 

if they graduate high school as a foster kid, they get free college, a lot of families wait to adopt for to that reason

If they age out at 18 and don’t want to go to college they get a lump sum payment which to me seems crazy, 

the other alternative is instead of getting the lump sum, you can opt to stay in the system until 21. Very few take advantage of this option|Just gonna be honest, these are all people who have never adopted kids talking about how it’s easier than everyone makes it seem. It’s like the blind arguing with the blind about what color something is|I learned about a year ago that adult adoption is a thing, at least in Ohio. Like one of the commenters said, family is forever.|As someone who intends to adopt in the near future, I can't agree more. 

Also, as a male, everyone asks me, ""you don't want to continue your lineage???"" and my answer is, ""why are  you so obsessed with MY lineage?"".|Husband and I are getting ready to take in a student of his whose mom is kicking her out at 18. Kid has nowhere to go, and what are we supposed to do, just know she's potentially homeless and do nothing? Because she's ""technically an adult"" we're supposed to pretend like she doesn't need and deserve care and support? Nah bruh. 

She's smart as hell and funny and sweet and if we can give her a break for once in her life and maybe show her what a real, loving marriage looks like and how it is to have a couple of adults around who care about you with no strings attached, why wouldn't we?

It's not going to be easy all the time, and my husband and I have had a few tough conversations leading up to it, but it's worth it. She's worth it.|I was disowned at 17 and if I had the option to be adopted into another family I would have taken it for sure|I went to a foster home at 12. I stayed in the same home the entire time. When I went away to college, I still went there for breaks, and even as a 27 year old, I still go to my foster family at holidays and go to all the family events. I wouldn’t say I am as close with them as I would be if it were my “real family” because going through the things I did *was* traumatic, and my foster mom was seriously flawed and didn’t always know how to raise me— I felt cared for but maybe not totally loved.

Anyway, I am supremely grateful I was never adopted because I was not financially tied to my foster parent. When I applied for college and financial aid, my expected family contribution was $0. I came out of school with no debt— I got grants and scholarships to cover everything. If I had been adopted, that would have been very different. My siblings— my foster mom’s biological children, are each around $40,000 in college debt and will be paying that off for most of their lives.

I know a lot of folks that are foster parents and I always explain and ask them to consider this. There are other ways to show someone that they are family.|[deleted]|My mom did this.

In college my wife and her friend got off the escalator to the top section of the arena at a John Mayer concert when they were approached by 2 employees, asked a few questions, and then brought down to the front row. Of course John Mayer would rather have 2 college aged girls in the front row over some stuffy old wealthy couple with the money to buy those tickets.|I like the game theory angle he's adding to the ticket buying process.|He also sells tickets behind the stage. I saw him in Florida years ago, and he plays a keyboard on a pedestal that spins around.

Such a waste.|Reality check: Billy Joel is a massive douchenozzle who played with his original band right up until they got famous enough to make money and then ditched them so he wouldn't have to pay them.

Amazing😁

Held strong until a grade 6 reading program finally broke the resolve and found out how to get them started. They are now a Peace Officer and a Red Seal Electrician. Not everybody is a rocket scientist. She finds her passion, and she will thrive. School is so hard on different learners, I hope she makes the best of it and does her real learning on her own. It's okay. A lot of us learn stuff in different ways, we don't all have to be by the book learners!|I remember one time I got like 10 great grades and three bad ones and my parents let me know very explicitly that they were disappointed and didn’t think there was anything worth celebrating 🥲|It's hard for me to believe that dads like this are real. \*tw: abuse mention\*   
For context, I brought home a report card with a C on it in the 7th grade. This led to my dad taking away every single thing in my room (music, books, crafts, etc), leaving me only with my bed, my dresser, my desk, and an empty bookshelf. For months, I was only allowed to clean, do homework, or study. He wouldn't even let me go to the library, go on family outings, watch tv or movies with them, or read for leisure (probably the worst part of all for me as reading was a huge form of escape from my abusive dad.) As a result of this, I read my school textbooks from cover to cover just to have something to do. This punishment only ended after he went 'too far' one of the times he was beating me and gave me a black eye. A teacher noticed and pulled me aside to ask about what happened, and I finally broke down. Lived with my mom for a few months before ultimately going back to living at his house.   
Anyway, I hope that those with dads like this (or people who are dads like this) find $20 on the ground and never experience back pain. I also hope my dad rots in hell.|This! This is how you treat a child when they're not doing well in school You don't vilify them, but encourage them to do better with love and kindness.

A child should never feel that his parents won't love them for doing wrong in some aspects of life, but they should feel encouraged by the people they love the most|I'm gonna get downvoted to hell, but here goes.... I find this questionable as a teacher. Hear me out.

If this kid truly has diagnosed ASD, she will likely have an IEP. That means she would had to have met few or NONE of her learning goals WITH accommodations. Teachers would likely have had to document all the interventions they tried before giving a failing grade.

She really got ALL D's? In every subject? Every teacher?  Either her school is exceptionally shitty, breaking the law, or private. Maybe all three.

Not saying this isn't real, I just find it very unlikely.|does that say ‘drawing and mailing robots’ because that is absolutely awesome|This is cute, but also he just kinda doxxed his daughter by using her full name.

On the exam, she rushed to reach the target speed and in doing so sacrificed accuracy, and they failed her because she made too many typos. When I got my certificate in the mail and she got a letter saying she failed, my parents instead made her a certificate as well.

It can be the light of a single star, piercing the dark, to remind you there's more out there than whatever you're dealing with. Unbreakable, unstoppable, but untouchable. It doesn't change your situation. You can't touch it, or even feel it, just...see it. Sometimes not even that, when the clouds come, you just have to know it's there. 

It can be the sound of trumpets and horns heralding reinforcements, the thunder of battle as your unlooked for allies ride to the rescue. Loud, brash, impossible to ignore, sweeping aside everything that stands between you and something better. 

It can be a breeze. Quiet. Invisible, barely felt, but it brushes aside the miasma that's been following you, letting you breathe again. Only for it to come back worse than before as the wind shifts. 

It can be a moment of silence, so easily shattered when the yelling starts again. 

It can be all those, and more.

And what's the biggest driver of deforestation?

[Over the last 10,000 years the world has lost one-third of its forests.](https://ourworldindata.org/world-lost-one-third-forests)

*An area twice the size of the United States. Half occurred in the last century. In just over 100 years the world lost as much forest as it had in the previous 9,000 years. An area the size of the United States. When we think of the growing pressures on land from modern populations we often picture sprawling megacities. But urban land accounts for just 1% of global habitable land, while pastures take 35%. Humanity’s biggest footprint is due to what we eat, not where we live.*

[Global meat production has more than tripled over the last 50 years. ](https://ourworldindata.org/soy)

*Beef stands out immediately. The expansion of pasture land to raise cattle was responsible for 41% of tropical deforestation. That’s 2.1 million hectares every year – about half the size of the Netherlands. Most of this converted land came from Brazil; its expansion of beef production accounts for one-quarter (24%) of tropical deforestation. This also means that most (72%) deforestation in Brazil is driven by cattle ranching.*

[Biodiversity conservation: The key is reducing meat consumption](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26231772/)

*Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity.*

[Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth)

I’m a little above average height (6’0”) and I’ve had more than a few women tell me my height is one of the things they like about me.

Small things legitimately can send kids into a riot. I am being serious. Not even saying this for humor purposes, they will RIOT over a banana with a narwhal on it. 

When they do this, it is almost impossible to get them to listen to you and it is a huge inconvenience. 

A lot of this artwork may also be problematic for other students. 6-year-olds get scared over stupid things. If they see what they deem scary painted onto a banana, they will tell their parents and their parents will bitch at the teacher because their child couldn't sleep the night after. Yes. They will do that. 

I see a lot of people calling the teacher a “bitch”, “too strict” etc. But she is probably outnumbered with 10+ kids in her class going crazy over a banana and is already stressed out as is because teachers are worked to the bone and get paid 💩.
