It basically showed that making new future LLMs could require substantially less money spent on GPUs than previously expected. That is why hardware companies like Nvidia got hit particularly hard. American companies can copy these techniques going forward, so Deepseek AI's relevance may be temporary. The important thing though is the innovations they made on the software side showed that hardware may be less important than previously thought. 

They also made the software open source and provided a thorough research paper on their process which means their techniques can be adopted by others.|I don't care if China wins.

And now the sub (and most of the Reddit) is filled with these. I don't mind if it helps people to start having a healthy discussion about said stuff, because like it or not, it helps shed light on what the actual truth is.

By healthy discussion, we can reach a point where both parties can agree on. But that's the problem. No one wants to agree on any similar points nowadays. Because they feel to agree to different people's opinions is to surrender their thoughts and bring change to theirs.

It's why you'll see people just posting content on this app but seldom few actually talk and discuss. It's what drives me crazy. Like , you posted the stuff but when asked questions to have a healthy discussion, there's almost no response.

Think of it as this anecdote: 

There's a public washroom at every bus station. Suppose they remove that washroom. What will happen? Where will people shit ?

Well, someone will take initiative and build their own public washroom and will take responsibility (or lack of it) to make it publicly available. The person can make it pay to visit, or make it full of restrictions. The people visiting who need to shit will shit, so they'll pay or comply to the person that made the provision. Sure, there will be some confusion at first, but people eventually get around it.

In this way, people will have to get around to shit within that person's limits and the person will get the profit or power around it, controlling however they deem fit.

The NYT has been sued and had to admit in the proceedings that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúbest seller‚Äù list. There is an ‚Äúeditorial‚Äù component, which means it‚Äôs subjective, and therefore not subject to the rigorous of empirical rankings.

The truth is, no one knows for sure. Industry insiders have a pretty good feel for how the list works, but ultimately, if the ‚Äúteam‚Äù as they‚Äôre known just decide they don‚Äôt want your book on the list, it‚Äôs not going on the list, no matter how many copies it sells.

Ultimately their refusal to create a real list of best sellers is why no one in the publishing world uses it anymore as a gauge of sales; Neilsen (ie the TV ratings company) is now considered the defacto source for book sales. Pretty much everyone but the NYT uses them now when making their best sellers list.

NYT bestseller = sold pretty good, plus the ‚Äúteam‚Äù liked it

They feels it‚Äôs an attack on a form of social media that the us government cannot control. So to get back at them for this ban, TikTok users are giving their data to china willingly.
