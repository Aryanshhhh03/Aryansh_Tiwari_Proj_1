Any negative emotion as a child and teen was ""You don't know what hardship is!"" and was emotionally minimalized... Even my first crushes were minimalized because as a teen, I didn't know ""true love"". Screw that!

So as a parent NOW, I make sure my kids have what I didn't: A safe place to discuss any and everything. Free from judgement. You wanna wear skirts? Wear them! You wanna be a mini goth? Go for it! Just lemme show you how to do eyeliner and fix up that black nail polish first. 

Life is literally based on experience, as is wisdom. My train of thought is this: if someone never lost a loved one, then lost their beloved goldfish, that's their first lesson of death and it's really traumatic. Don't throw your dead grandparents at them just to teach a lesson. ""Someone always has it worse"" is the toxic positivity that fucked me up. 

That's why a lot of pre-teens come to my home in my neighborhood now. Their parents don't listen or want to understand. I was literally there. Your first crush IS true love. In that moment. 

""100 different people in a single room and there will be 100 different types of love."" That's a quote I hold dear because everyone experiences everything differently. There should NEVER be a competition of pain, loss, happiness and victories. That's the true poison of social media: We hold each other to our own standards. Not the standards of the people living through their own lives. 

If my children were to ever, EVER tell me that they're unhappy with me, we will have a talk and discuss what I can do better as a parent and what they do as a child. If I'm the only one screwing up, then I will take all of that constructive criticism and keep trying to do better. We've had to tip-toe around some things and keep some things private, but I explain the losses and gains(pros and cons) of both. 

Children are just growing to be adults. It's our jobs as adults and parents to provide that growing room for our future generations. It's also our job to pick the correct partner to keep that space at home safe. Whether or not you think our children are listening, they are. Body language and all.

I‚Äôm not saying to act entitled, but when a problem comes up, be truthful about whatever is going on and ask for help. Whether it‚Äôs classes, your major, tests, jobs, money, relationships, roommates, living conditions, whatever it is‚Äîdon‚Äôt struggle through it alone, go ask and find someone to help you. 

Best of luck and enjoy college!|Pro tip 1: attend every class. 

Pro tip 2: take notes in class, and re-read them later in the day before sleeping. This helps you fill in the gaps in what you wrote and remember what the unclear parts of your notes mean.

You've got this!|You got this!! Go forth and be awesome :)|Good luck! Here is my advice you didn‚Äôt ask for: if you ever start to fall behind, talk to your teachers about it earlier rather than later. My professors were almost always looking out for me, and were incredibly understanding (my bipolar made college really hard, it was an emotional time). So the earlier you get on top of it the better! Mine were willing to be flexible with deadlines and offer me extra help when needed.

You‚Äôll do great!! You have the most important thing: the desire to go forth and learn üê∑|Nice fit, you‚Äôll do great! Good job üëèüèΩ| AWESOME!!

This has been my whole life and I've just *gotten by.* Like life is a constant struggle but I've woken up every day and fought for my life. And sometimes, I've won. So now I have a fairly successful career, despite a lot of struggle and professional adversity and I have A TON of sympathy for those coming up through the ranks. 

At the same time, when the ranks show up and tell me they just don't have the mental energy like... I don't know what to do. I get it, working corporate America kind of sucks. But you've agreed to do a job. If you're not able to perform the job, I can barely keep you, let alone give big promotions or raises just for ""showing up.""

I get that showing up some days IS the battle, but like, if you're not performing, I don't have a professional framework to reward ""I managed the bare minimum which for me was pretty good."" 

I want to treat everyone fairly and create opportunities but I don't know what to do when someone tells me they just ""can't."" Like, I can't either but we're here so I kind of need you to do your work just like I am doing mine?? 

We have unlimited PTO, paid FMLA including mental leave, etc. I am happy for my staff to use these resources and regularly promote their healthy use.

As a doctor, you are going to deal with people of all orientations who engage in sexual activity you find unhealthy, or drugs, or other dangerous activities. You treat them EXACTLY the same as you would anyone else. 

She hasn't been a resident for very long, but I don't think she has ever had to treat someone for a medical reason related to homosexuality. You're probably a million times more likely to deal with a bad liver due to drinking, lung cancer due to smoking, and (where we are from) meth related health issues. Also I don't have local statistics, but I can tell you self harm cases are on the rise. And the hospital she works at doesn't have a child psychology department, so that impacts the ongoing care our local youth receives.

\-take a shower or bath: It will make you feel clean, and you can have a nice drink or something in the bath, use some nice soap, read a book, light a candle

\-take a break from your phone, or whatever device you are using: social media is full of stupid distractions, and things that will make you sad. Take a break and do something else

\- clean : cleaning at least some, so that you can see a bit of a difference will help. You can have gotten something done, and a clean, tidy home reduces depression and anxiety

\- take a walk: if it is nice weather out, take a walk, get some fresh air 

\- eat a little if you have not eaten today: food is good for your stomach. Have something healthy like yogurt, or whatever fits your health needs

Goofy clothes or not I would live with your parents.|Idk, I don‚Äôt think every parent necessarily uses their kid as an excuse to play dress up with their dolls. I never really did that as a kid, and my favorite part about how I grew up was that I was given the freedom to choose what I wanted to wear, so I have tons of old pictures of me looking absolutely ridiculous, goofy, sometimes cute, but allllways mix matched if it wasn‚Äôt for a family photo shoot or some sort of nicely groomed holiday gathering. I remember wearing my power ranger costumes almost daily for a very dangerously long time. I would wear tutus every day after school. Did I do ballet? Absolutely not. I was eating Cheetos and watching tv and spinning in circles in the corner of the room. It felt like a fun childhood. And sure I still have no sense of fashion now as an adult, but I also don‚Äôt care about it. I dress in black usually just because it doesn‚Äôt stand out and I‚Äôm always absolutely comfortable. And if for some reason I have to look cute, I can put something together and have fun with it. My daughter is a year old now and we have cycled through so many ‚Äúcute‚Äù fashionable but entirely uncomfortable clothes in every size so far because neither I, nor my partner, nor my baby have any interest in wearing them. Homie just wants a soft onesie and some pants and she‚Äôs as happy as can be. I can‚Äôt WAIT until she‚Äôs in the store with me picking out her clothes by herself and making those memories that I did. Making tons of fashion choices she will later regret, trying and never succeeding to be truly HIP and TRENDY when you‚Äôre 13 and giving up and beginning your counter-culture journey to liberated self expression. I love that for her. I can appreciate fashion because I was given freedom of choice, but I always chose comfort lol.|Todays kids will never know, it‚Äôs so sad .|Which is which?

Sexualizing children gets a lot of attention, but really the crime is adulting children. Making them into miniature adults instead of letting them have the experience of being a child. I don't know nothing. That just came to my head. If it doesn't make sense, I do not care.|Oh yes, my purple pants were my absolute fave. I backed the 90's, in the 90's that is.|NO LIES HERE...

They can have accessories and shoes that show their individual interest and personality (witnessed this first hand in a budget conscious household and it worked out fine)|I‚Äôd rather dress my kids like kids instead of miniature adults any day.|I was born in 83 and in all my pics the clothes all looked what I would now consider ugly as hell!!

I just think kids are happier with simple art and they don‚Äôt want to try to be clean all the time kids are happy to go get dirty and play with bugs and make salads out of grass playing with their baby dolls and playing mom not trying to stay perfectly immaculate looking in like an exact copy cat of their 28 year-old mother!! I personally don‚Äôt find it cute and I would be embarrassed as a mom to be posting my small children like that. They literally look like a miniature adults!! Spending 100 and some dollars on Jordans when a kid would rather have a pair of Batman and Spider-Man light up shoes that cost 20 bucks just stupid to me!! save your money while they‚Äôre young because when they get older, some costs are not avoidable!! raise your kids to recycle things my kids love a Saturday morning at the thrift store or getting up early on a weekend and rummaging!

She'll have a good balance of colorful clothes and neutrals, but not enough to be too extreme on both ends of the color spectrum. Color is beautiful and important to appreciate. She can wear whatever colors though and rock it too! Hopefully it helps her as she gets older to be able to figure out what style she enjoys the most. B)

One Thanksgiving my family was arguing all day, and dinner was pretty miserable. I was thankful it was over when my mom moved the leftover turkey into the kitchen to get wrapped up for the fridge. My mom sat with me at the table for a little while to calm me down because I was understandably upset. Out of nowhere, I started laughing, and she got really confused. We have an open floor plan so you can see right into the kitchen from the dining room table. Past my mom, in the kitchen, David had jumped up on the counter and started nibbling at the part of the turkey that wasn‚Äôt covered by foil. He got a decent mouthful before I could stop laughing long enough to tell my mom what was happening. When she turned around, she couldn‚Äôt stop laughing either! When she could take a breath, she went over to the kitchen and picked him up to put him back down. She was crying laughing while trying to cover the bare parts of turkey to keep him from doing it again. He also liked to lick the frosting off unattended baked goods, especially cheap grocery store sheet cakes.

He was my best friend growing up. I miss him, but things like this help me remember the better times before old age caught up with him. I loved that cat, and I hope that on the other side of the rainbow bridge he‚Äôs eating all the Thanksgiving turkey he can handle.",wholesomemes,wrceel

I'm aware of them and have heard them, and they are interesting and talented. I'm just not into the mixing of those two genres beyond it being a novelty personally.

It's not for me and that's fine. I understand the appeal and can see their talent and work ethic despite the style of music not jiving with me.

I'm self aware enough to realize I in no way rock harder than they do, and respect them for being out there despite not caring for their music.

I also think that last guy doesn't ""get"" metal if he thinks music that ""makes me want to kill things"", even metaphorically, isn't metal AF.

This made me respect Rob Zombie more than ever, fuck those gatekeeping assholes.

I don't really get that kind of attitude towards music. I also don't care for BTS or Nickelback, but still respect the hell out of those guys for what they've accomplished.

This is not limited to just music of course, but it's just what is most relevant here.
