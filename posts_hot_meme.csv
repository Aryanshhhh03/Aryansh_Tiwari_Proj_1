You dont know the context."" Bro, how does the context of him doing the salute change to a good thing if he does it in a political thank-you-speech?

edit for bad english|Response for anyone saying that it's the Roman salute or a sweet heart gesture or ""the same as others have done in the past"":

\--You can NOT be serious. **Nobody** on earth uses that gesture for ""my heart goes out to you"". That isn't a thing. It doesn't even make sense to mean that, and it has **never** been used for that by anyone in any context.

\--The Roman salute also isn't a thing in this era. It has forever been usurped by the Nazi salute and you damn well know it. When was the last time you saw **anyone** do that and intend for it to be the Roman salute? The Roman salute wasn't even part of the public consciousness until today.

\--And if you watch the full videos from which photos are shown of other people doing that gesture, it's super clear that it's just part of a freeze-frame during a normal hand gesture while talking or waving to the crowd, and not this aggressive, purposeful intent to do **only** the Nazi salute and nothing else. That includes some Republicans by the way. Well, except for that one Laura Ingraham video.

L'Oreal was started by an actual french nazi, Hugo Boss was the one making the uniforms for the nazis, Nestle supplied food to the nazi soldiers, many US banks finnanced the nazis, Henry Ford was literally given a medal by Hitler himself, even the NASA employed at some point some nazis (*and after the war*...)

Are any of these companies controlled today by the same founders? No.
Are they run today with the same values? Most (that we are aware of) no 
(Nestle for example is the exception among some other banks that never addressed what they did too cause Nestle is activily doing some other sh#t as we speak that needs a lot of attention too and its a shame people barely talk about it)

\--You can NOT be serious. **Nobody** on earth uses that gesture for ""my heart goes out to you"". That isn't a thing. It doesn't even make sense to mean that, and it has **never** been used for that by anyone in any context.

\--The Roman salute also isn't a thing in this era. It has forever been usurped by the Nazi salute and you damn well know it. When was the last time you saw **anyone** do that and intend for it to be the Roman salute? The Roman salute wasn't even part of the public consciousness until today.

\--And if you watch the full videos from which photos are shown of other people doing that gesture, it's super clear that it's just part of a freeze-frame during a normal hand gesture while talking or waving to the crowd, and not this aggressive, purposeful intent to do **only** the Nazi salute and nothing else.

There is this idea that people who only need it to lose a few pounds should never be on it, but many of them only need to lose “a few” BECAUSE they’ve been putting in the hard work for years or even decades. People who have starved themselves for years, only for their binge eating disorder to rear its ugly head and undo months of work in a day.
