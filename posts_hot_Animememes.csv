Noisy Crazy Bizarre Town - basically is to just show us the fun weird characters in the town, the same characters that make the town noisy, crazy and fucking bizarre in the first place

Chase - it comes at a part where the heros are probably at their worse, that one kid dies and the heros just get by in their fight with Kira

Dropped it after the 3rd chapter and couldn‚Äôt continue watching.|I barely power through it to be fair it was obnoxious as hell itself, the people giving him direction that the scream was good should get fired|It's honestly a really fair thing to do. Asta was extremely obnoxious in the early parts of the show. I was one of the people that dropped it then. I just picked it up again. On my third try I finally made it past a few episodes, and it was definitely worth it. Great show.

But still, those early episodes are horrific. On the cusp of irredeemability.|For me it's simple; if I chose to watch then I am going to finish it. Doesn't matter how bad it is. Though Black Clover is one of my most favourites Anime/Manga. Thanks to it, I started watching One Piece and Bleach.|Same, i dropped the anime on ep 4, because of it, i was a fan of the manga, but I hate it when MCs scream all the time, I hated when Naruto did it too.|Absolutely a fair thing to do. He is way too anoying|Black Clover is one of the animes where the English dub is better. Animes in the fantasy genre are better experienced in English because of the Western-style designs and settings imo. And sorry, but I really couldn't stand Asta's Japanese VA as well. I watched the English dub and I enjoyed it. Asta's screaming is more bearable there, and the English VAs sound great too. So if anyone still wants to try, I suggest the English dub.|I dropped it cuz my fav character is one of the only characters that gets killed off for some reason|I feel like I wouldn't watch it because of that. But, how is the manga? I might just do that.|i dropped it after the 10th episode-|Same, I told my friend who recommended the anime that Asta was yelling too much and i had to skip the portions of the MC itself when he came on screen. But boy I'm glad that i didn't skip the anime. 

My gf also loved the anime after seeing me invested in this anime and we both are waiting for the remaining part|Oh God I thought I was alone on this!!!

I gotta admit it yes, oh yes I hated his screaming so much. And if it wasn't because I'm the dumb type to never leave things undone, I would've FOR SURE stopped watching it but 3 things kept me going. The fact that it had too many episodes out to not be at least interesting story wise (or so I thought) and the openings were quite good to me. But yeah gotta say it twice, I only finished it up to date because of my ""always finish everything you start"" bullsh*t mentality...|I think i watched the first season, not really sure where i left off as i was waiting for dubbed episodes. I did mostly enjoy the show but Asta's constant yelling was absolutely the worst part of the show.|We talking dub or sub? The original japanese voice actor would hit this tone in his screams that vibrated at just the right tone to make me want to jam pencils into my ears. I opted to stop after 2 episodes. Is the English va also pain inducing?|The (Japanese) VA gets way better and the English dub is fine from the beginning.

Honestly one of the better shonens out there I think. Not very original at all but it's execution is spot on, and it doesn't suffer from the misogyny/backgrounding of women that so many other shows do. Also it doesn't just give up on the ending like JJK/MHA/demon slayer|This was always valid criticism tho watching black clover is like watching naruto but its just naruto himself on a 10 hr loop yelling dattebayo!

Itachi could solo most armies



Sanin could handle most tails by themselves and Orochimaru / Jiraya both could solo most armies

  
Tsunade + Itachi means UNLIMITED ~~BLADE~~ EYE WORKS

  
Imagine a Jiraya + Tsunade romance actually working with Orochimaru being helpful 3rd wheel, if they were to have a kid, would be OP

  
if Naruto was raised in this setting tho, he'd be a terrible kid.

Also yea, imaging the curb stomp the leaf would do to the world|admiting that they still have harsh upcoming that make them as strong if not stronger then in the otl because with an alive minato and a trio sannin that is 100% loyal to the leaf would pretty much clear out almost every issues and be enough to dominate the others villages and any others treats, and the younger generation would not need to train hard or even have to face hard situation so they would end up weaker in comparaison

but with a team like that with all their power, yeah so if i was a shinobi form another village i would not even bother waking up  
konoha would have 12 kage level shinobi casually living in the village, that is already one of the most populated and powerfull overall (konoha has more shinobi and they are generaly better, taking the basic shinobi)

without mentionning the new generation coming up, plus some character that would be born due to people surviving longer, like the childs of tsunade and jiraya, rin and obito, potential sister/brother to naruto, kakashi not being traumatised as much and potentially founding a family ect ect

uchiwa clan used to the max (potentially discovering a new way to unlock the sharingan like sadara) new uzumaki clan, ect|IF you think about it, Naruto anime was actually pretty horrible. They train children to fight their wars.|Fire|The ninjas would all be out of a job.|It's crazy how the actual fire nation's power is kept at bay only because of rogue koniha shinobis, and these rogues from konoha Or those related to them are always the main problem in the shinobi world|Damn, I want to see an AU of this, but it probably wouldn't have stakes|This is overkill for anything¬†|Why does kakashi still have sharingan, with Obito, (both eyes intact) is still there",Animememes,1hzugui

Read Wikia if you're not going to do it properly.|You could pick up a book and start reading from any page, follow a cooking recipe from any step, use water to lather yourself and soap to rinse it off.. eh.|Because the east blue part is the best part duh xD no jokes aside U could just start anywhere but there will be things U don't fully understand and if ur okay with it it's fine ^-^|Because Dr who is almost an anthology, except for some special episode you don't need to watch anything else, one piece needs you to watch the thousand episodes of yap to understand what happens|Because doctor who for the most part is episodic, where the story is contained within each episode, kind of in the same way most kids cartoons are like gumball or adventure time or even the adult shows of Family guy and American dad, there will be throwbacks but you can jump in at any time. One piece is telling an ongoing story, same way Naruto or fairytail are, you can't exactly jump into it because there is already a lot that has happened to lead to this exact point of X season, even with a recap you would be doing it justice on how much necessary info and peak cinema people would be missing out on.

TLDR, They are not even close to the same style of show and have completely different pacing so you can't really compare them|Ig I‚Äôd understand if you‚Äôd say any point before timeskip but if you start after timeskip and then watch pre, either you‚Äôll get bored of pre timeskip or you will just spoil some parts for yourself (for example aces death and the death of the merry)



In the case of doctor who, there are not too many references to past doctors and even if there are, you can still understand it and not ruin it for yourself as each doctor has a different story|This makes zero sense to me, why bother watching one piece at all of you are going to just skip over half of the goddamn show????|Because it would be like ""watch this series, don't worry you can skip everything and go with no context to this 190 chapter long season that is making me curse the writer for somehow coming up with enough content for an 80ish chapter long final battle, like how? and why? The anime is good, the season is great, but 50 chapters was enough and you are just making me suffer""|[removed]|I started on voltron, but i started my friend on deathnote|Yeah because East blue saga is the BEST place to start??|The beginning tbh. Different shows are made with different storytelling in mind. Dr.Who resets with a new doctor every few years which essentially resets the story. Yeah there is continuity from doctor to doctor but they rarely call back to something a previous doctor has done. Star Wars was made in 3 part trilogies that are their own stories they do connect but can stand cause of their structure, same for lord of the rings and the hobbit. Manga/ anime storytelling usually doesn‚Äôt work like this.|One piece is booty|Wano is probably the worst starting point for new fans 

Act 1 is heavily built on following through on set up done during dressrosa and Zou. With its biggest moments all being payoffs to past arcs. the revelation that the scabbards are time travelers, Zoro‚Äôs reunion with Luffy, Big Mom showing up among other things 

I imagine all that is a slog that makes it quite unapproachable for the uninitiated|Wano is just one of the worst pacing for one piece, arguably writing too but the pacing is so horrendous I don‚Äôt even need to factor it in.

There are a few characters i actually do like, but a lot is really obnoxious. I really hate how there's no stakes really. Literally no one dies when they should, including literal marine grunts. It's just boring because you know that no one will die. I actually prefer fanfics more. At least the actual good ones that aren't just shipping, which explore the Lore. Like, there's the whole rest of the world besides the grand line to see. There's a really good one called the butcher bird. It's a bit edgy, but not too much. A lot of good characters and world building. Also, this bites is really good too, and somehow has actually caught up with the actual series. This bites is great, because it's an si that isn't overpowered. In fact, what's interesting Is that the sun is actually much weaker than the average one piece human, because even the weakest marine grunts can get thrown through walls and survive with minor injury. So he has to rely more on being really intimidating. He's actually smart too, and ends up with a worldwide podcast.

We produced a huge army and a gigantic number of things for that war by the way, it's almost ludicrous (800 thousand lorries for instance and the 4th largest navy by 1945). Somehow someone got the idea to fake a Nazi invasion of Manitoba, on 19 February 1942, that region highlighted in red, and make the people there aware of what the Nazis would do to a place under occupation (they didn't shoot anyone though), like arresting important local people, the priests, burning books (which had been selected from the library beforehand which were rotten or otherwise to be replaced or thrown out regardless). The event was over by the end of the day, but ended up raising millions of dollars that day and tens of millions in less than two weeks. It was called If Day.

Naturally, if the Germans were to invade, they would do something like put a weather station in the Dominion of Newfoundland. Oh wait, they actually did that.¬†[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather\_Station\_Kurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Station_Kurt)

The title is a reference to how our lunatic prime minister at the time, Mackenzie King, was an occultist who claimed to communicate with a variety of dead people, his own dogs, and other weird things. Somehow he remains one of the most popular prime ministers in Canada. Tom Scott video narrated by the son of Chris Hadfield to explain just WTF he was:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTF8KYoJkMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTF8KYoJkMM)

I know that the leader of Manitoba is called a premier conventionally in Canada but I used prime minister so that I didn't have to explain Canadian politics. Prime Minister of Newfoundland would actually be correct for the time though.",Animememes,1he3bdc

Reason: men|Rurouni Kenshin because the story in self is excellent and the action are the Best that I see in a shonen anime|Of ALL time, Gintama, Votoms, Kekkai Sensen, and Kyousougiga.|Hunter x Hunter 1999

Has just really great atmosphere.|Initial d why? Because car go vroom vroom|Code Geass because of Lelouch.|Got 2 favorites:  
1)bunny girl senpai - reason: mai sakurajima  
2)frieren - loved the adventure and animation|Made in Abyss - the animation isn't something that will blow your brains out (it's average, NOT ugly), but the worldbuilding and character development are extremely detailed and well made and the mix between mystery, unknown and the story is spot on and not too unbalanced.|Katanagatari.

Good humor got execution on the story, cool characters, and depressing/shocking ending it has everything i want in a show|Re Zero : I absolutely love the concept and showing how everything Affects Subaru progressively and All the wide range of characters from Emilia to Rem including all the OP characters while Subaru is in depression|Mirai Nikki (brings amazing emotions cried like 4 times on first watch)|Monogatari


I love witty dialog, half an episode can be just a single conversation that takes place in the same room but I'm at the very edge of my seat


It has some of the best written female characters. I hate 1 dimensional characters that ONLY exist to provide a love interest or fan service (Like misa misa in death note). It use to be way more prevalent than it is now


Story and visuals are brilliantly abstract, every episode you're saying WTF to yourself at least 10 times. There are times you feel humor, anger, disgust, and joy, some times all at once|My newest recent favourite is Makeine, even people who don't watch slice of life will sit to watch this show|Cory in the House. Cause the memes

But for real, my favorite is probably either Spice and Wolf because I enjoy the banter and chemistry between the male and female leads, the slow burn romance that isn't rom-com slow burn, but actually goes somewhere is nice too. The other is Cyberpunk Edgerunners, love studio trigger's art, plus cyberpunk is one of my favorite table top games, and even though it follows the videogame more, it still captures Night City well, and the fact that it wasn't a happy ending was nice, wouldn't feel cyberpunk if it was.

I want group of really ambitious women to compete with each other to get a powerful position in a huge empire with manipulation, murder, corruption etc.|Context?|Lazy writing vs. Slavery of actual real women|Well, it's an anime, a medium for you to escape from real life and make your imagination runs wild. You can say the same to most genre too, like School Life, Romance, etc. The only exception imo is sports in some degree, as this is the only genre when the power of friendship is real and completely justified as it often happens too in real life.|It has historically been proven that harems are not the safest places in the world. For example, imagine you are a sultan in the times of the Ottoman Empire or a maharaja in pre-colonial India and at your command, there is a bevy of women ready to get pregnant for your attention. At the beginning it all seems nice and fun, but little by little you realize that in your harem there is a ring of plots, poisonings and commissioned murders to murder the other concubines and in the worst case, the targets of their diabolical aims are you. yourself, to allow one of your sons to succeed to the throne and the mother of the future sovereign with him. I'm sorry to ruin the fantasies of many, but reality often surpasses fantasy.|MORMONS|See you in Bangkok jail|It isn't good in anime either.|Meanwhile Hyodo Issei:|Some things are only good in animes, like Tsunderes|TFW the one harem anime you watched was School Days|This is your friendly reminder that a harem in real life was all women in a man's family, specifically the head of household. His mother was in his harem, his sisters, cousins, daughters, their daughters... It was not just his wives. In many ways they were equivalent to the ladies of court and of the court and members would often hold a lot of power.

The idea that harems are basically just where these men kept the women they had sex with and all these women did was hang around and wait for the men to come see them is based off a fetishization by, if memory serves, the British.

Anyway the short version is you have the images backwards.|Except the king of Thailand is sorta interesting unlike the average harem MC|Well irl it rarely comes to pass because some average looking guy is just irresistible to multiple women|I dislike harems and anime as well because they are usually a sign of terrible writing and generic nonsense as well.|Only harem anime I ever saw ending well was Tenchi Muyo‚Äôs OVA universe, where he just decided to marry them all, and they all slowly got pregnant, and they all live in this weird found family situation on Earth where they‚Äôre all fine just being there with Tenchi. It must have been a weird transition though- going from Tenchi just being a ‚Äúnice guy I like‚Äù to the to ‚Äúactively sexual‚Äù part of relationships in that house that full .

In a positive point, he recognizes the inherent problem with consent (especially since magic is involved).

But I think a huge problem is Bleach's fanbase,  
I have 2 friends who are fans and I have met a lot of fans online, they always keep yapping like ""Bleach is a masterpiece"", ""Bleach is peak"", ""Bleach is the best anime"", etc. Well I don't deny it or affirm it but it gets my appeal of watching bleach quite low. And no hate but I have grown a silent anger towards Bleach. So I think you guys should calm down and there are a lot of things to discuss in a fanbase than how great an anime is. I have seen a lot of posts, reels, tweets, etc. just saying how great bleach is. I think that will just kill the appeal of someone who hasn't watched Bleach. You guys should instead discuss characters, abilities, memes, etc. to build interest in community. And no, I haven't watched One piece or Naruto either.|Bleach? More like PEAK|I watched the first 12 episodes and thought the pacing and animation sucked. I was a lot more patient with Naruto though.|Speaking facts cap

Not much would be different... Anyway, I love the anime, and it was a shame that it wasn't complete. I hope that a new anime tells the complete story|Honestly, I wanna watch this now. Thanks for the recommendation|Well I mean it wouldn't though would it? We get so many popular anime with strong female characters that don't get called woke.

Look at Fate/Stay, nearly everything is spearheaded by strong female characters, the last 3 films came out only a few years ago, apocratha came out at the start of the 'everything is woke epidemic' and featured astolfo and gender swapped morder and no one cared (astolfo is pretty popular in fact) 

If you want more recent there's Freiren that was beloved and had a strong female lead, same with apothecary diaries, we have dandadan now. There's Shangri-La, Ranma 1/2 remake, witch from Mercury, 86, Mushoku Tensei, Tengoku Daimakyou, Yofukashi No Uta.

These are just from the last 2 years, and all of them were pretty widely popular featuring a strong female or trans character in their leading role or main cast.

In fact it's a pretty common trope that the leading man is a weak pushover who's life is changed becused a female character with a strong or dominant personality.

2: Most of light novel authors take their inspiration from MMOs and turn based rpg games so we have a story with the player,NPCS and enemies .  None of characters is actually written to be like a real human

Vinland saga without the slavery would be historically inaccurate. Then you have the fantasy settings where it is a genre typical thing to have it. I've never read a fantasy book that did not have slavery in it. When it is portrayed as a daily thing for the characters I don't see it as problematic because throughout history it wasn't. When it's portrayed as a good thing you can argue it's problematic but I've never seen a hero in an anime being happy about it existing. The one that comes to mind is the rising of the shield hero where the hero buys a slave and is not that opposed to the concept. This is arguably a harmful use of the concept because slavery is not adequately discussed and the effect on it leaves on a person not addressed enough.|Well it makes sense with the setting. Believe it or not there was a time in human history where slavery really was just normal.|The title is right if we talk about Fairy Tail.

However, one of two things usually happens with popular series: They don't get an ending/have a rushed ending, or they should have been allowed to end organically a while ago and are now being forced to continue in an unwanted direction. This doesn't just apply to anime or even animated shows in general, either.

That being said, just ignore people who give you grief for something *you* genuinely enjoy. It brings you warm fuzzies and doesn't harm anyone or hamper their own enjoyment of their favorite things, so go ahead and indulge. They're having difficulty with the fact that different people have different tastes and that it's okay for someone to like something they don't. Possibly subconsciously envious that they no longer get to experience the same enjoyment that you still are.|I do love rwby but I can‚Äôt lie and say the quality of the show post season 3 till season 8-9 was pretty god awful.

Are his friends, this show is an undying love letter to the man who created it and the fans who love it. If you don't like it thats fine, but we dont need an entire fucking doctoral thesis. Or 30 minute fucking video essay as to why you don't. If you don't like it move on to something you enjoy. Let us have our thing and you have yours.

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
