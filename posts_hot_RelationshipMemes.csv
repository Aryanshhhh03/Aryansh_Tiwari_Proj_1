There‚Äôs nuance here. You can‚Äôt expect someone to be a mind reader but some things are obviously common sense. You should remember to get your partner something for their birthday. If you forget, they have a right to be upset. If they want something very specific, they say nothing and you don‚Äôt get that for them, their upset is unreasonable. Labor should be divided equally and you should do your half without having to be asked. If they want you to do something differently than usual, that needs to be talked about.|I feel like people in the comments are not getting it lol. It's not saying ""I never want to have to tell my partner anything"". It's saying ""It's great when you have a partner who picks up on your passions and interests through genuinely listening to you rather than needing to be explicitly told everything"". 

For instance, my boyfriend has super niche interests in history and culture. Particularly, he finds Turkmenistan and oriental rugs to be interesting. He nerds out about it all the time. He doesn't know that I've secretly bought him a big century-old Turkmen hand-crafted tribal rug. 

Did he ask for it? No. Can I tell he wants one but is too afraid to ask because they're expensive? Yes. 


Communication is important but y'all should be able to pick up on context clues too. If you really know your partner, you shouldn't have to be explicitly told everything.|It is exhausting to have to ask for the slightest bit of help around the house. I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask for my partner to check if the dogs have water and to refill their bowls, to put dirty dishes in the sink or wash them, to take the trash out, to get the mail, to bring the package in that was sitting at the front door that they walked past in order to come in. I want a partner who notices things need done and just does them instead of waiting for me to do it or ask them to do it. At least that is how I interpret the original post.|Date a mind reader then|These type of women are annoying as hell üòÇ|So, guessing and getting the ‚Äúclues‚Äù.
No, I don‚Äôt need my partner to man up, but have a honest communication.

I would love to have a significant other that wants me and doesn't want to fuck around and find out for a cute little game. I won't get to experience that. It is apparently socially acceptable to fuck me over and force me to live with bad experiences. Can't date without others using things I have said in the past to hold me back from moving on. Can't have sex (but all these other men my age can?). Can't build a home. Can't have children (even though I already have one and am too fucked in the head to be her mother). Can't have someone tell me the truth (who knows how many other women this guy was fucking while he was sharing ""friendship and companionship"" with me). I don't get to have anything I hoped or dreamed of when I was child. I sure as fuck don't get to have anything I wanted as an adult. What got delivered to me is nothing but heartbreak and bad experiences disguised as friends and companionship. Seems to me that it isn't very friendly to be fucking around on someone and keeping them from moving on, all because you have unbridled access to them. Apparently it is okay for someone to fuck over another, and that person just have to live with taking it up the ass. Fuckboys are going to fuckboy. I haven't known fidelity ever. I guess I am supposed to be loyal to a man who can go fuck multiple women and do whatever he wants when he wants? I don't want to be in a relationship with a manipulative person, who purposely will choose to hurt me. All because they can.

Had two bad exs. One was a shameless liar, the other needed control and always have me around to feel safe in the relationship. 

Only reason they are exs is because I ""rebelled"" and rejected being controlled, so they both broke up with me. 
Sadly, I commit too fast and tolerate abuse like manipulation, gaslighting and inconsistencies.
Good thing about me though is not having abandonment issues. Having rejected hoover attempts. One No Contact, the other little contact. I became close to second ex's mother and brother and they are very good friends.

My sister got lucky. They rarely see eachother during the week days, because both work with a massive river separating their cities (Lisboa/Set√∫bal). Every weekend they meet, either at our home or at his. They are happy and make it work.

Helped him get his international passport and he came to visit during the first year of COVID, we self isolated together in my father's caravan. Had an informal wedding on The Flitch Way, couldn't legally get married on his visa. Worked my ass off for a year because of travel restrictions and working towards his visa to stay in my country but then we were one key document away from starting the process and the war broke out. Initially I wanted him in my country but at every step theres been brick walls, COVID, the war and changes to immigration preventing us from settling in one of our countries. 
After that one year of saving for the financial requirements for his visa which turned out pointless I went and lived with him for a year. Just returned again after being in my country for 8 months. So now I've another year in his country unless I apply for a residence permit. Only difficulty is figuring out where to settle when there's been so many problems jumping in our way. 
We work very well together and have maintained a good relationship the whole time, he's additionally helped me better myself (went from 20y extreme introvert, morbidly obese girl who didn't leave the house for almost a year to a self-confident 26y, healthy fitness lady, ambivert who can take 3 planes a quarter then way around the world to stay in a foreign country and talk in a foreign language to random strangers).

If she wants you to communicate more, it means she misses you and wants to hear from you more. Some men think women are being clingy or needy when they do this. In turn, women are forced to wait for you to reach out because you tell her she's not respecting your independence. Bro, if you want to enjoy your full independence, stay single. If she isn't voicing out what she wants to improve in the relationship, she doesn't really care in the first place.

In fact, if someone sends you those kinds of messages or flirts with you despite knowing that you are already in a relationship, it's not a flex.

In my marriage I have veto on my wife's attire and she has on my. If I dress like a slob she can veto that and request I change (I can deny but later she will be upset) and I can request she changes (she again can deny, but it will make me feel uncomfortable)

If she wanted to put her boobs on display when she went out, she could... Even if I asked her to change... Though if she didn't listen, we wouldn't be married. I don't need other men oogling my wife. If we go out together, dress code expectation is more relaxed on my end, and probably more strict on what my wife expects. She makes me dress up better, while I am more relaxed with what I don't consider ok as I am there in case she feels uncomfortable with somebody...

Sorry, but if that's your face when you hear ""my boyfriend wouldn't let me wear that"", then you are the problem. Get out of other people's relationships. If you want to dress like a slut (or for guys equivalent is like a slob... We often overdo it with comfort instead of looking presentable) then do it when you are single or if you have a guy who doesn't care... Don't shame girls that want to make their guys feel good in relationships with them. Also...

No arguments because everyone keeps the toilet closed when not in use, it's always expected to be closed and it keeps the bathroom more clean.|I‚Äôm a guy. Both sides of this are quite valid; respect and common courtesy for each other. Looking at the sink the way that it is now, you can hardly move if you are trying to wash your hands. And if a small child has to wash their hands in that sink? Forget it. Ironically, some of the ladies who do this will be quick to place blame on the person who accidentally knocks any of it into the sink or onto the floor.|Completely. Just own it & move on.|you should both put the lid down|Flushing the toilet with the seat up can shoot fecal particles six ft in the air. I would literally never.

Just never have guests...|Sounds like you‚Äôre both lazy|If you‚Äôre gonna complain about a toilet seat just make sure your stuff is together üòÇ|That mess around the sink, if it is a shared facility is selfish and rude.  So is leaving the toilet seat up.  That kind of tit-for-tat does not a healthy relationship make.|Respect must be mutual. If you want the toilet seat down, keep the sink area reasonably clean and vice versa. Period.|Same vein of women saying ""Men need to stop spreading their legs on seats"" while they are taking up 2 whole seats with their bags.|If you don't give a shit enough to do something extremely simple for your spouse, like put your shit away or put the toilet seat down

You're a shitty person, and straight up should work on yourself before you take the plunge and dedicate yourself to another person.|This is why having cats equals everything out lmao. Not only do we have to keep the lid closed because the little idiots will get into the bowl, we also can't have that much shit on our counter because it'll get knocked off.

Seriously though ESH, It's an equal-gender thing guys, it's gross to flush with the lid open (you ever see a diagram of how toilets spray particles everywhere?), and it's messy and annoying to have shit all over your counter. Close the lid and buy a makeup bag or under-the-sink organizer. Both sexes should be clean people regardless.|Poop and pee particles are not the same as messy countertops.  That‚Äôs disgusting to even imagine flushing with the toilet seat up or to sit on the rim because the seat is up.  However‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I also wouldn‚Äôt leave my makeup out in the room with a toilet.  I don‚Äôt even keep my toothbrush in my bathroom though so I might be a weirdo.  Maybe get a mirror and do the makeup somewhere you can leave it out for a while if you want.  I‚Äôve seen some really nice used vanities lately that would solve that!|This is a classical distraction argument. Yes you should organise a bit better so there's space at the sink but that doesn't mean what he is doing is justified. It's just saying you do bad things too so I don't have to be good|I wouldn't be able to stand a mess like that either|Science tells us leaving the toilet seat down is the most stupid and most dirty configuration a toilet can be. The proper thing is to put the lid down. But because now women will also have to lift the lid each time, women will refuse to do it.|it's justified if you're leaving stuff in FRONT of the sink, otherwise not really|No because if you don‚Äôt put the lid (and therefore seat) down you‚Äôre just getting shit and piss particles everywhere which is not the same as just leaving clutter out. 

But if he is annoyed by you taking up an entire sink that‚Äôs also valid for different reasons; maybe an under the sink organizer or some small shelves to put your stuff on instead?|YES!",RelationshipMemes,1dxk3lj

Sometimes I'd be texting you all those sweet nothings while I'm on the crapper tbh.|That's why gamers are the best partners, our mistress is the game.|I really hate how the adoption of smart phones has made everyone feel *entitled* to access my attention at all times.

Me ""no, im playin fallout""|Or they are pretending to not be too eager.|Hmm‚Ä¶ sometimes. 

It‚Äôs funny because I can tell what game or game mode he‚Äôs on based on the frequency. (We play the same video games.)

I know if my messages are urgent or I‚Äôm upset, he would prioritize them though, or call, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs having fun.|I dunno lots of games don‚Äôt function in ‚Äúrounds‚Äù lookin at you RPGs and ARPGs and MMOs‚Ä¶|Can also be that he‚Äôs taking those 25 minutes to formulate the response he thinks will make him seem engaged and interesting.

After all, I‚Äôve yet to meet the guy who hasn‚Äôt been ghosted repeatedly in the middle of conversations that seem to be going great.  As a result, some guys start to think they are accidentally tripping unseen red flags, or giving the impression they aren‚Äôt fully engaged, or that they said something stupid, etc.

So they get obsessed with crafting a message *just right* in the hopes they will avoid said pitfalls.  Since they are trying to anticipate mistakes they have never gotten feedback on, that is a mostly useless endeavor that results in long periods of re-writing the same message repeatedly. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Alternatively, they could be busy with any number of things.  Games is a good possibility if the times between messages are consistently the same length.

In short, it‚Äôs rare a guy is ever ‚Äòplaying games‚Äô over text.  That‚Äôs crediting guys with waaay too much savvy in predicting and manipulating the preferences of women. üòÖ

Mostly we are just trying our best to figure out how to avoid looking too eager, but still invested, and at the same time trying to avoid getting ghosted in the middle of a conversation.

All because we rarely ever get feedback from the woman we are talking to if we make a misstep.  So guys are guessing constantly.  You can‚Äôt play games in that state. üòÇüòÖ|Maybe he‚Äôs at work. I have a job where sometimes I can‚Äôt even have my phone on me so to safely regulations. Chill out. Or maybe he thinks if he texts you back in 5 seconds you‚Äôll thinks he‚Äôs a creep or sucker. We can‚Äôt tell because society has men in pins & needles for everything we do. If the conversation is going great just be into that. Not like he‚Äôs boring or waiting three days|i understand that completely but when we‚Äôre in a middle of a conversation like an important stuff, it‚Äôs infuriating if he responds an hour later|Pretty much lol|Texting is like emails. If you have time you respond if not you are not. That is why they invented phone calls ot face to face meetings.
