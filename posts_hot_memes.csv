They like weird departures from normalized formulas because at least it's new, we like familiar concepts and nostalgia bait. There is a dichotomy at the most basic level here.|My face when movie critics critic a movie|“Grrrr! I hate when informed people have opinions that contrast with my gut reaction!”|Dude, not every movie that presents itself as fun is actually fun, that can be a possibility too you know. These memes always feel like they come from people who liked a movie, but didn't get their opinion validated|This is why I always read audience reviews, not critics|It helps to read (or view?) the reviews instead of just looking at scores. Take “The Room” as an example. It’s a trash movie that is VERY entertaining and most reviews say exactly that while giving it a thumbs down.

It’s perfectly fine to enjoy McDonalds, but if you’re a serious food critic you still can’t give it the same prestige as a fine dining restaurant.|Audience reaction is frequently higher because it's a poll of people who had enough interest in the movie to see it.|I'm sure most people live mediocre lives. Maybe that's why most seem to just like mindless entertainment|A movie can be bad media and still be fun. A story can make no sense and still be entertaining.

The point of guidelines on writing is to reduce slop you have to sift through to FIND a good time, and that is also the point of critics. 

That being said, modern critics are more disconnected from their audience and media than before, and for evidence look no further than audience scores vs critics scores.

They should have a more in depth perspective on movies and along with a vast experience they should give a more close to objective opinion.

Having said that, this is not always the case, they are still humans subjected to their own personal views, they can also be paid to inflate the ratings so unfortunately their approach often derails from the objective analysis.

One thing is for sure, though: we, normal viewers, are amateurs so it's quite irrelevant what they say/vote to us.

It's not testosterone that causes baldness but it is a derivative of testosterone that does known as DHT (dihydro testosterone). Now if you still have enough hair to cover your head properly then you could get on a regimen of foods that happen to block an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. The function of an enzyme is to speed up a chemical reaction process. This enzyme is directly responsible for converting the healthy testosterone into DHT that is miniaturizing your hair follicles to the point that they become dormant & hair mainly falls off in a diffuse pattern causing folks to stick to shorter hairstyles. 

If your hair is already gone then the best thing you can do is go for a transplant but if it's not too late then stick to this diet, exercise (strength training & cardio) also helps regulate DHT levels & in 1 or 2 years you'll see a difference.

The urine was then used to extract ammonia, which was used to make saltpeter for gunpowder. In the mornings, the collectors drove around town with a barrel and paid money for the urine. Of course, there were cunning townspeople who began to dilute the product. Then a new profession appeared - the urine taster, who organoleptically determined the quality and concentration of precious ammonia. But the New Age came, people learned to synthesize ammonia or extract it by other means, and the profession of urine taster became unnecessary.
