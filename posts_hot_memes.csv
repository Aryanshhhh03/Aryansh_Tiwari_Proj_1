Take ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù as an example. It‚Äôs a trash movie that is VERY entertaining and most reviews say exactly that while giving it a thumbs down.

The point of guidelines on writing is to reduce slop you have to sift through to FIND a good time, and that is also the point of critics.

They should have a more in depth perspective on movies and along with a vast experience they should give a more close to objective opinion.

Having said that, this is not always the case, they are still humans subjected to their own personal views, they can also be paid to inflate the ratings so unfortunately their approach often derails from the objective analysis.

One thing is for sure, though: we, normal viewers, are amateurs so it's quite irrelevant what they say/vote to us.

It's banned in the exact same way they always said it was going to be banned... Go try to download it on the app store right now. Can't, can you?

The only thing that happened was TikTok themselves decided to shut down their service in the US one night, and then turn it back on the next morning - none of that was in the rules of the ban. The ban only said it can no longer be offered in the app stores, and it's not. The fake ban by tiktok was just a publicity stunt.

As of right now it still works, but new american users can't come online, and after a few rounds of smartphone updates it'll probably start to break because the app won't be able to get updates.

It's not testosterone that causes baldness but it is a derivative of testosterone that does known as DHT (dihydro testosterone). Now if you still have enough hair to cover your head properly then you could get on a regimen of foods that happen to block an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. The function of an enzyme is to speed up a chemical reaction process. This enzyme is directly responsible for converting the healthy testosterone into DHT that is miniaturizing your hair follicles to the point that they become dormant & hair mainly falls off in a diffuse pattern causing folks to stick to shorter hairstyles. 

If your hair is already gone then the best thing you can do is go for a transplant but if it's not too late then stick to this diet, exercise (strength training & cardio) also helps regulate DHT levels & in 1 or 2 years you'll see a difference.

Of course, there were cunning townspeople who began to dilute the product. Then a new profession appeared - the urine taster, who organoleptically determined the quality and concentration of precious ammonia. But the New Age came, people learned to synthesize ammonia or extract it by other means, and the profession of urine taster became unnecessary.
